Conventional methods for detecting SNPs are typically based on PCR or DNA sequencing, which is time-consuming, costly, and requires complex instrumentation. In this study, we present a duplex probe-directed recombinase amplification (duplex-PDRA) assay that can perform real-time detection of two SNPs (rs6983267 and rs1447295) in four reactions in two tubes at 39 degrees C within 30 min. The sensitivity of duplex-PDRA was 2 x 10(3) -10(4) copies per reaction and no cross-reactivity was observed. A total of 382 clinical samples (179 prostate cancer patients and 203 controls) from northern China were collected and tested by duplex-PDRA assay and direct sequencing. The genotyping results were completely identical. In addition, the association analysis of two SNPs with prostate cancer risk and bone metastasis was conducted. We found that the TT genotype of rs6983267 (OR: 0.42; 95%CI: 0.23-0.78; P=0.005) decreased the risk of prostate cancer, while the CA genotype of rs1447295 (OR: 1.89; 95%CI: 1.20-2.96; P=0.005) increased the risk of prostate cancer. However, no association between the two SNPs (rs6983267 and rs1447295) and bone metastasis in prostate cancer was found in this study (P >0.05). In conclusion, the duplex-PDRA assay is an effective method for the simultaneous detection of two SNPs and shows great potential for widespread use in research and clinical settings.",NA,NA,"",2021,54,"2",NA,"10.1590/1414-431X20209549",NA,"1414-431X20209549"

Here, we hypothesize that the barriers to dispersal created by large oceanic expanses and deep-water trenches result in a heterogeneous distribution of the neutral genetic diversity between island bull shark populations compared to populations sampled in continental locations connected through continuous coastlines of continental shelves. We analyzed 1,494 high-quality neutral single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in 215 individual bull sharks from widespread locations across the Indian and Pacific Oceans (South Africa, Indonesia, Western Australia, Papua New Guinea, eastern Australia, New Caledonia, and Fiji). Genomic analyses revealed partitioning between remote insular and continental populations, with the Fiji population being genetically different from all other locations sampled (F-ST = 0.034-0.044, P < 0.001), and New Caledonia showing marginal isolation (F-ST = 0.016-0.024, P < 0.001; albeit based on a small sample size) from most sampled sites. Discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) identified samples from Fiji as a distinct cluster with all other sites clustering together. Genetic structure analyses (Admixture, fastStructure and AssignPOP) further supported the genetic isolation of bull sharks from Fiji, with the analyses in agreement. The observed differentiation in bull sharks from Fiji makes this site of special interest, as it indicates a lack of migration through dispersal across deep-water trenches and large ocean expanses.",NA,NA,"DEC 14",2020,7,"",NA,"10.3389/fmars.2020.586015",NA,"fmars.2020.586015"

Addressing this deficiency requires understanding the drivers of population divergence and the spatial scales at which they operate in species-rich clades and ecosystems. South Africa's Succulent Karoo (SK) hotspot provides an excellent system for such research, being both compact (ca. 110,000 km(2)) and home to spectacular in-situ radiations, such as the ruschioid Aizoaceae. Here we use GBS to document genetic structure in two co-occurring ruschioid species, at both coarse (>10 km) and fine (<500 m) spatial scales. Where Ruschia burtoniae shows strong between-population genetic differentiation and no gene flow, Conophytum calculus shows weak differentiation, with high levels of admixture suggesting recent or ongoing gene flow. Community analysis and transplant experiments reveal that R. burtoniae occupies a narrow, low-pH edaphic niche, and at scales of a few hundred metres, areas of elevated genetic turnover correspond to patches of edaphically unsuitable habitat. In contrast, C. calculus occupies a broader niche and exhibits isolation-by-distance without a habitat effect. We suggest that edaphic specialisation, coupled with highly restricted seed and pollen dispersal in heterogeneous landscapes, has played a major role in driving rapid diversification at small spatial scales in this system. However, the contrasting patterns in our study species show that these factors do not influence all organisms uniformly, being strongly modulated by lineage-specific traits that influence both the spatial scale of gene flow and habitat specificity.",NA,NA,"JAN",2021,30,"1",NA,"10.1111/mec.15721",NA,"mec.15721"

Transcriptome sequencing was conducted on two genotypes and 628 transcript sequences containing 959 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were developed. A competitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) assay was developed for the SNPs and used for genotyping of 24 accessions. A total of 554 loci were successfully genotyped across the accessions, and 202 polymorphic loci were used for population genetics analyses. Polymorphism information content (PIC) of the loci varied from 0.01 to 0.37 with a mean of 0.24, and about 49% of the loci showed significant deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The mean expected heterozygosity was 0.27 suggesting moderately high genetic variation within accessions. Low but significant differentiation existed among accessions (FST = 0.045, p < 0.0001).

Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is one of the most translocated and farmed aquaculture species globally, farmed throughout Asia, North and South America, and its African native range. In Egypt, a breeding program established the Abbassa Strain of Nile tilapia (AS) in 2002 based on local broodstock sourced from the Nile River. The AS has been intensively selected for growth and has gone through genetic bottlenecks which have likely shifted levels and composition of genetic diversity within the strain. Consequently, there are questions on the possible genetic impact AS escapees may have on endemic populations of Nile tilapia. However, to date there have been no genetic studies comparing genetic changes in the domesticated AS to local wild populations. This study used 9,827 genome-wide SNPs to investigate population genetic structure and signatures of selection in the AS (generations 9-11) and eight wild Nile tilapia populations from Egypt. SNP analyses identified two major genetic clusters (captive and wild populations), with wild populations showing evidence of isolation-by-distance among the Nile Delta and upstream riverine populations. Between genetic clusters, approximately 6.9% of SNPs were identified as outliers with outliers identified on all 22 O. niloticus chromosomes. A lack of localized outlier clustering on the genome suggests that no genes of major effect were presently detected. The AS has retained high levels of genetic diversity (H-o_All = 0.21 +/- 0.01; H-e_All = 0.23 +/- 0.01) when compared to wild populations (H-o_All = 0.18 +/- 0.01; H-e_All = 0.17 +/- 0.01) after 11 years of domestication and selective breeding. Additionally, 565 SNPs were unique within the AS line. While these private SNPs may be due to domestication signals or founder effects, it is suspected that introgression with blue tilapia (Oreochromis aureus) has occurred. This study highlights the importance of understanding the effects of domestication in addition to wild population structure to inform future management and dissemination decisions. Furthermore, by conducting a baseline genetic study of wild populations prior to the dissemination of a domestic line, the effects of aquaculture on these populations can be monitored over time.",NA,NA,"OCT 15",2020,11,"",NA,"10.3389/fgene.2020.567969",NA,"fgene.2020.567969"

This presents a challenge to define management units. Goldsinny wrasse (Ctenolabrus rupestris) is a heavily exploited species due to its importance as a cleaner-fish in commercial salmonid aquaculture. However, at the present, the population genetic structure of this species is still largely unresolved. Here, full-genome sequencing was used to produce the first genomic reference for this species, to study population-genomic divergence among four geographically distinct populations, and, to identify informative SNP markers for future studies. Results: After construction of a de novo assembly, the genome was estimated to be highly polymorphic and of similar to 600Mbp in size. 33,235 SNPs were thereafter selected to assess genomic diversity and differentiation among four populations collected from Scandinavia, Scotland, and Spain. GlobalF(ST)among these populations was 0.015-0.092. Approximately 4% of the investigated loci were identified as putative global outliers, and similar to 1% within Scandinavia. SNPs showing large divergence (F-ST > 0.15) were picked as candidate diagnostic markers for population assignment. One hundred seventy-three of the most diagnostic SNPs between the two Scandinavian populations were validated by genotyping 47 individuals from each end of the species' Scandinavian distribution range. Sixty-nine of these SNPs were significantly (p < 0.05) differentiated (meanF(ST_173_loci) = 0.065, F-ST_69_loci = 0.140). Using these validated SNPs, individuals were assigned with high probability (>= 94%) to their populations of origin. Conclusions: Goldsinny wrasse displays a highly polymorphic genome, and substantial population genomic structure. Diversifying selection likely affects population structuring globally and within Scandinavia.

To better understand the genetic structure of chicken breeds under different selection pressures, we genotyped various chicken populations with specific selection targets, including indigenous, commercial, gamecock, and wild ancestral chickens, using the 600K SNP array. We analyzed the population structure, genetic relationships, run of homozygosity (ROH), effective population number (Ne), and other genetic parameters. The wild ancestral population, red junglefowl (RJF), possessed the highest diversity, in comparison with all other domesticated populations, which was supported by linkage disequilibrium decay (LD), effective population number, and ROH analyses. The gamecock breeds, which were subjected to stronger male-biased selection for fighting-related traits, also presented higher variation than the commercial and indigenous breeds. Admixture analysis also indicated that game breed is a relatively independent branch of Chinese local breeds. Following intense selection for reproductive and productive traits, the commercial lines showed the least diversity. We also observed that the European local chickens had lower genetic variation than the Chinese local breeds, which could be attributed to the shorter history of the European breed. ROH were present in a breed specific manner and 191 ROH island were detected on four groups (commercial, local, game and wild chickens). These ROH islands were involved in egg production, growth and silky feathers and other traits. Moreover, we estimated the effective sex ratio of these breeds to demonstrate the change in the ratio of the two sexes. We found that commercial chickens had a greater sex imbalance between females and males. The commercial lines showed the highest female-to-male ratios. Interestingly, RJF comprised a greater proportion of males than females. Our results show the population genetics of chickens under selection pressures, and can aid in the development of better conservation strategies for different chicken breeds.",NA,NA,"SEP 25",2020,11,"",NA,"10.3389/fgene.2020.543294",NA,"fgene.2020.543294"

As commercial demand rises for marine resources, it is critical to generate baseline information for monitoring wild populations. Furthermore, anthropogenic stressors on the coastal environment, such as warming sea temperatures and overharvesting of wild populations, are leading to the destruction of keystone marine species such as kelps. In this study, we conducted a fine-scale genetic analysis using genome-wide high-density markers on Northwest Atlantic sugar kelp.

The greater stick-nest rat (GSNR,Leporillus conditor), a threatened Australian rodent, has been the focus of a translocation program since 1985, resulting in five extant translocated populations (St Peter Island, Reevesby Island, Arid Recovery, Salutation Island and Mt Gibson), all derived from a remnant wild population on the East and West Franklin Islands. We evaluated the genetic diversity in all extant GSNR populations using a large single nucleotide polymorphism dataset with the explicit purpose of informing future translocation planning. Our results show varying levels of genetic divergence, inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity in all translocated populations relative to the remnant source on the Franklin Islands. All translocated populations would benefit from supplementation to increase genetic diversity, but two-Salutation Island and Mt Gibson-are of highest priority. We recommend a targeted admixture approach, in which animals for supplementation are sourced from populations that have low relatedness to the recipient population.

In order to assess genetic variation and how this relates to environment in the honeycomb worm (Sabellaria alveolata(L.)), a reef-building polychaete that supports high biodiversity, we carried out RAD sequencing using individuals from along its complete latitudinal range. Patterns of neutral population genetic structure were compared to larval dispersal as predicted by ocean circulation modelling, and outlier analyses and genotype-environment association tests were used to attempt to identify loci under selection in relation to local temperature data. Results We genotyped 482 filtered SNPs, from 68 individuals across nine sites, 27 of which were identified as outliers using BAYESCAN and ARLEQUIN. All outlier loci were potentially under balancing selection, despite previous evidence of local adaptation in the system. Limited gene flow was observed among reef-sites (F-ST = 0.28 +/- 0.10), in line with the low dispersal potential identified by the larval dispersal models. The North Atlantic reef emerged as a distinct population and this was linked to high local larval retention and the effect of the North Atlantic Current on dispersal. Conclusions As an isolated population, with limited potential for natural genetic or demographic augmentation from other reefs, the North Atlantic site warrants conservation attention in order to preserve not only this species, but above all the crucial functional ecological roles that are associated with their bioconstructions.

Understanding the genetic factors influencing expression of OSA may lead to new treatment strategies. Electronic health records (EHRs) can be leveraged to both validate previously reported OSA-associated genomic variation and detect novel relationships between these variants and comorbidities. Methods We identified candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) via systematic literature review of existing research. Using datasets available at Geisinger (n = 39,407) and Vanderbilt University Medical Center (n = 24,084), we evaluated associations between 40 previously implicated SNPs and OSA diagnosis, defined using clinical codes. We also evaluated associations between these SNPs and OSA severity measures obtained from sleep reports at Geisinger (n = 6571). Finally, we used a phenome-wide association study approach to help reveal pleiotropic genetic effects between OSA candidate SNPs and other clinical codes and laboratory values available in the EHR. Results Most previously reported OSA candidate SNPs showed minimal to no evidence for associations with OSA diagnosis or severity in the EHR-derived datasets. Three SNPs inLEPR,MMP-9, andGABBR1validated for an association with OSA diagnosis in European Americans; the SNP inGABBR1was associated following meta-analysis of results from both clinical populations. TheGABBR1andLEPRSNPs, and one additional SNP, were associated with OSA severity measures in European Americans from Geisinger. Three additional candidate OSA SNPs were not associated with OSA-related traits but instead with hyperlipidemia and autoimmune diseases of the thyroid. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is one of the largest candidate gene studies and one of the first phenome-wide association studies of OSA genomic variation. Results validate genetic associates with OSA in theLEPR, MMP-9andGABBR1genes, but suggest that the majority of previously identified genetic associations with OSA may be false positives.

Evidence suggests that genetic variants may change vulnerability to depression by modulating DNA methylation (DNAm) and non-coding RNA (ncRNA) levels. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the effect of the genetic variation, previously identified in the largest genome-wide association study for depression, on proximal DNAm and ncRNA levels. Results We performed DNAm quantitative trait locus (meQTL) analysis in two independent cohorts (totaln= 435 healthy individuals), testing associations between 102 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and DNAm levels in whole blood. We identified and replicated 64 SNP-CpG pairs (p(adj.)< 0.05) with meQTL effect. Lower DNAm at cg02098413 located in theHACE1promoter conferred by the risk allele (C allele) at rs1933802 was associated with higher risk for depression (p(raw)= 0.014, DNAm = 2.3%). In 1202 CD14+ cells sorted from blood, DNAm at cg02088412 positively correlated withHACE1mRNA expression. Investigation in postmortem brain tissue of adults diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) indicated 1% higher DNAm at cg02098413 in neurons and lowerHACE1mRNA expression in CA1 hippocampus of MDD patients compared with healthy controls (p= 0.008 and 0.012, respectively). Expression QTL analysis in blood of 74 adolescent revealed that hsa-miR-3664-5p was associated with rs7117514 (SHANK2) (p(adj.)= 0.015, mRNA difference = 5.2%). Gene ontology analysis of the miRNA target genes highlighted implication in neuronal processes. Conclusions Collectively, our findings from a multi-tissue (blood and brain) and multi-layered (genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic) approach suggest that genetic factors may influence depression by modulating DNAm and miRNA levels. Alterations atHACE1andSHANK2loci imply potential mechanisms, such as oxidative stress in the brain, underlying depression.

Even though disparities exist between human populations,e.g., the higher liver fat content of the Japanese despite a lower body mass index (BMI), studies on the genetics of obesity still largely focus on populations of European descent, leading to a dearth of genetic data on non-European populations. In this context, this study aimed to establish a broad picture of the genetic attributes of the Japanese population, by examining a representative sample of 18,889 individuals participating in the Tohoku Medical Megabank Project cohort. We applied linear mixed model methods to 17 traits related to obesity and associated diseases to estimate the heritabilities explained by common genetic variants and the genetic correlations between each pair of traits. These analyses allowed us to quantify the SNP heritability of health indicators such as BMI (0.248 +/- 0.032) and HDL cholesterol (0.324 +/- 0.031), and to provide one of the few estimates of the SNP heritability of cystatin C in unrelated individuals (0.260 +/- 0.025). We discuss potential differences between the Japanese and people of European ancestry with respect to the genetic correlations between urinary biomarkers and adiposity traits, for which large estimates were obtained. For instance, the genetic correlations between urine potassium level and the values for weight, BMI, waist circumference, and waist-to-height ratio ranged from 0.290 to 0.559, much higher than the corresponding estimates in the UK Biobank.",NA,NA,"JUL",2020,10,"7",NA,"10.1534/g3.120.401242",NA,"g3.120.401242"

Our aim was to study genetic associations of chronotype among 8433 Finns from the cross-sectional National FINRISK 2007 and 2012 studies. First, we studied associations between chronotype and 20 key clock genes with a candidate-gene approach and then performed a full genome-wide association study (GWAS) of chronotype. We also developed a genetic risk score (GRS) for chronotype based on 313 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have previously been associated with chronotype. Chronotype was assessed with a shortened version of Horne and ostberg's Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (sMEQ), and for comparison, we also used the single self-evaluation question on chronotype from the questionnaire. Linear and logistic regression was used for statistical analysis assuming additive effects. The clock gene analysis revealed 1 independent association signal withinNR1D2(lead SNP rs4131403) that was associated with chronotype (p< 0.05; as based on both chronotype assessment methods). The GWAS analysis did not yield any genome-wide significant associations (p> 5 x 10(-8)).

Use of extended torpor occurs in the southernmost portion of the range, putting the species at risk of bat white-nose syndrome, a fungal disease responsible for massive population declines in North American bats.

We sampled 66 individuals across the species range and discovered pronounced isolation-by-distance. Furthermore, and surprisingly, we found higher degrees of heterozygosity in the southernmost populations compared to the north. A coalescence analysis revealed that our populations may still not have reached secondary contact after the Last Glacial Maximum. As for the potential spread of pathogens, such as the fungus causing WNS, connectivity among populations was noticeably low, especially between the southern hibernatory populations in the Magallanes and Tierra del Fuego, and more northerly populations.

However, the role of host genetic polymorphisms in modulating maternal CMV status is inconclusive. This study investigated the possible association of single nucleotide polymorphisms in toll-like receptor (TLR) and cytokine genes with maternal plasma CMV DNA status in black Zimbabweans. Methods In a cross-sectional study, 110 women in late gestation who included 36 CMV infected cases and 74 CMV uninfected, age and HIV status matched controls were enrolled. Twenty single nucleotide polymorphisms in 10 genes which code for proteins involved in immunity against CMV were genotyped using Iplex GOLD SNP genotyping protocol on the Agena MassARRAY (R) system. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata SE and the 'Genetics' and 'SNPassoc' packages of the statistical package R. Results The TLR7 rs179008A > T (p < 0.001) polymorphism was associated while the TLR9 rs352139T > C (p = 0.049) polymorphism was on the borderline for association with CMV positive (CMV+) status. In contrast, the interleukin (IL)-6 rs10499563T > C (p < 0.001) and TLR2 rs1816702C > T (p = 0.001) polymorphisms were associated with CMV negative (CMV-) status. Furthermore, allele frequencies of SNPs in TLR2, TLR4, TLR9, TLR7, IL-6, IL-10, IL-28B, IL-1A and interferon AR1 (IFNAR1) genes are being reported here for the first time in a Zimbabwean population. The allele frequencies in the Zimbabwean population are generally comparable to other African populations but different when compared to European and Asian populations.

We analysed 26,090 ejaculates of 794 Brown Swiss bulls to assess ejaculate volume, sperm concentration, sperm motility, sperm head and tail anomalies and insemination success. The heritability of the six semen traits was between 0 and 0.26. Genome-wide association testing on 607,511 SNPs revealed a QTL on bovine chromosome 6 that was associated with sperm motility (P = 2.5 x 10(-27)), head (P = 2.0 x 10(-44)) and tail anomalies (P = 7.2 x 10(-49)) and insemination success (P = 9.9 x 10(-13)). The QTL harbors a recessive allele that compromises semen quality and male fertility. We replicated the effect of the QTL on fertility (P = 7.1 x 10(-32)) in an independent cohort of 2481 Brown Swiss bulls. The analysis of whole-genome sequencing data revealed that a synonymous variant (BTA6:58373887C>T, rs474302732) in WDR19 encoding WD repeat-containing protein 19 was in linkage disequilibrium with the fertility-associated haplotype. WD repeat-containing protein 19 is a constituent of the intraflagellar transport complex that is essential for the physiological function of motile cilia and flagella. Bioinformatic and transcription analyses revealed that the BTA6:58373887 T-allele activates a cryptic exonic splice site that eliminates three evolutionarily conserved amino acids from WDR19. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the BTA6:58373887 T-allele decreases protein expression. We make the remarkable observation that, in spite of negative effects on semen quality and bull fertility, the BTA6:58373887 T-allele has a frequency of 24% in the Brown Swiss population. Our findings are the first to uncover a variant that is associated with quantitative variation in semen quality and male fertility in cattle. Author summary In cattle farming, artificial insemination is the most common method of breeding. To ensure high fertilization rates, ejaculate quality and insemination success are closely monitored in artificial insemination bulls. We analyse semen quality, insemination success and microarray-called genotypes at more than 600,000 genome-wide SNP markers of 794 bulls to identify a recessive allele that compromises semen quality. We take advantage of whole-genome sequencing to pinpoint a variant in the coding sequence of WDR19 encoding WD repeat-containing protein 19 that activates a novel exonic splice site. Our results indicate that cryptic splicing in WDR19 is associated with reduced male reproductive performance.

The Wright's fixation index (F-st) and the principal component analysis (PCA) are widely used methods in animal genetics studies. In paper we compared the power of these methods, their complementing each other and which of them is the most powerful. Results Comparative analysis of the power Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and F-st were carried out to reveal genetic differences between herds of Holsteinized cows. Totally, 803 BovineSNP50 genotypes of cows from 13 herds were used in current study. Obtained F-st values were in the range of 0.002-0.012 (mean 0.0049) while for rare SNPs with MAF 0.0001-0.005 they were even smaller in the range of 0.001-0.01 (mean 0.0027). Genetic relatedness of the cows in the herds was the cause of such small F-st values. The contribution of rare alleles with MAF 0.0001-0.01 to the F-st values was much less than common alleles and this effect depends on linkage disequilibrium (LD). Despite of substantial change in the MAF spectrum and the number of SNPs we observed small effect size of LD - based pruning on F-st data. PCA analysis confirmed the mutual admixture and small genetic difference between herds. Moreover, PCA analysis of the herds based on the visualization the results of a single eigenvector cannot be used to significantly differentiate herds. Only summed eigenvectors should be used to realize full power of PCA to differentiate small between herds genetic difference. Finally, we presented evidences that the significance of F-st data far exceeds the significance of PCA data when these methods are used to reveal genetic differences between herds. Conclusions LD - based pruning had a small effect on findings of F-st and PCA analyzes. Therefore, for weakly structured populations the LD - based pruning is not effective. In addition, our results show that the significance of genetic differences between herds obtained by F-st analysis exceeds the values of PCA. Proposed, to differentiate herds or low structured populations we recommend primarily using the F-st approach and only then PCA.",NA,NA,"APR 28",2020,21,"1",NA,"10.1186/s12863-020-00848-0",NA,"s12863-020-00848-0"

In the current study, using a test battery exposing the dogs to novel stimuli, we compared the behavior of three groups of beagles: (1) kenneled dogs living in a restricted environment with limited human contact (N = 78), (2) family dogs living in human families as pets (N = 37), and (3) adopted dogs born in the kenneled population but raised in human families (N = 13). We found one factor comprising most of the test behaviors, labeled as Responsiveness. Family dogs and adopted dogs scored higher in Responsiveness than kenneled dogs. However, 23% of the kenneled dogs were comparable to family and adopted dogs based on a cluster analysis, indicating a similar (positive) reaction to novel stimuli, while 77% of the kenneled dogs were unresponsive (mostly immobile) in at least part of the test. To assess if the behavioral difference between the family and kenneled dogs could be due to genetic divergence of these two populations and/or to lower genetic diversity of the kenneled dogs, we analyzed their genetic structure using 11 microsatellite markers. We found no significant difference between the populations in their genetic diversity (i.e., heterozygosity, level of inbreeding), nor any evidence that the family and kenneled populations originated from different genetic pools. Thus, the behavior difference between the groups more likely reflects a G x E interaction, that is, the influence of specific genetic variants manifesting under specific environmental conditions (kennel life). Nevertheless, some kenneled individuals were (genetically) more resistant to social and environmental deprivation.

This can advance our understanding and aid decision making regarding management and conservation efforts. Microsatellites have long been used in population genetic studies. Thanks to the development of newer techniques, sequencing approaches such as restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) are on their way to replace microsatellites for some applications. However, the performance of these two marker types in population genetics have rarely been systematically compared. We utilized three neutrally and adaptively differentiated populations of anadromous pike (Esox lucius) to assess the relative performance of microsatellites and RADseq with respect to resolution and conclusiveness of estimates of population differentiation and genetic structure. To this end, the same set of individuals (N = 64) were genotyped with both RADseq and microsatellite markers. To assess effects of sample size, the same subset of 10 randomly chosen individuals from each population (N = 30 in total) were also genotyped with both methods. Comparisons of estimated genetic diversity and structure showed that both markers were able to uncover genetic structuring. The full RADseq dataset provided the clearest detection of the finer scaled genetic structuring, and the other three datasets (full and subset microsatellite, and subset RADseq) provided comparable results. A search for outlier loci performed on the full SNP dataset pointed to signs of selection potentially associated with salinity and temperature, exemplifying the utility of RADseq to inform about the importance of different environmental factors. To evaluate whether performance differences between the markers are general or context specific, the results of previous studies that have investigated population structure using both marker types were synthesized. The synthesis revealed that RADseq performed as well as, or better than microsatellites in detecting genetic structuring in the included studies. The differences in the ability to detect population structure, both in the present and the previous studies, are likely explained by the higher number of loci typically utilized in RADseq compared to microsatellite analysis, as increasing the number of markers will (regardless of the marker type) increase power and allow for clearer detection and higher resolution of genetic structure.",NA,NA,"MAR 13",2020,11,"",NA,"10.3389/fgene.2020.00218",NA,"fgene.2020.00218"

The subset of traits that were measured in both cohorts (locomotor activity, body weight, and coat color) showed high genetic correlations, although the SNP heritabilities were slightly lower in the F39-43 cohort. For this subset of traits, we attempted to replicate loci identified in either F-34 or F39-43 in the other cohort. Coat color was robustly replicated; locomotor activity and body weight were only partially replicated, which was inconsistent with our power simulations. We used a random effects model to show that the partial replications could not be explained by Winner's Curse but could be explained by study-specific heterogeneity. Despite this heterogeneity, we performed a mega-analysis by combining F-34 and F39-43 cohorts (n = 1,028), which identified four novel loci associated with locomotor activity and body weight. These results illustrate that even with the high degree of genetic and environmental control possible in our experimental system, replication was hindered by study-specific heterogeneity, which has broad implications for ongoing concerns about reproducibility.",NA,NA,"MAR",2020,10,"3",NA,"10.1534/g3.119.400763",NA,"g3.119.400763"

However, GWAS-identified SNPs, as identified with stringent statistical significance, explain just a small portion of the overall estimated genetic heritability. To address this 'missing heritability' issue, gene- and pathway-based analysis, and biological mechanisms, have been used for many GWAS studies. However, many of these methods often neglect the correlation between genes and between pathways. Methods: We constructed a hierarchical component model that considers correlations both between genes and between pathways. Based on this model, we propose a novel pathway analysis method for GWAS datasets, Hierarchical structural Component Model for Pathway analysis of Common vAriants (HisCoM-PCA). HisCoM-PCA first summarizes the common variants of each gene, first at the gene-level, and then analyzes all pathways simultaneously by ridge-type penalization of both the gene and pathway effects on the phenotype. Statistical significance of the gene and pathway coefficients can be examined by permutation tests. Results: Using the simulation data set of Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 (GAW17), for both binary and continuous phenotypes, we showed that HisCoM-PCA well-controlled type I error, and had a higher empirical power compared to several other methods. In addition, we applied our method to a SNP chip dataset of KARE for four human physiologic traits: (1) type 2 diabetes; (2) hypertension; (3) systolic blood pressure; and (4) diastolic blood pressure. Those results showed that HisCoM-PCA could successfully identify signal pathways with superior statistical and biological significance.

Variation in abundance and timing of megalopae recruitment has been extensively studied for over two decades in Coos Bay, Oregon, United States. Within the CCE, documented timing of Dungeness crab life history events indicates that coastal megalopae recruitment is expected to occur April through July; however, long-term studies in Coos Bay have observed late-season recruitment from August to October. Based on variation at 1,913 presumably neutral loci, evidence was found for weak, yet significant differentiation (F-ST estimate = 0.0011) between the 2014 expected-season recruits (n = 47) and late-season recruits (n = 47) collected in Coos Bay. However, two putatively adaptive loci with a high F-ST estimate (0.2036) between expected-season and late-season recruits were identified.

Recently, new, efficient technologies for genotyping thousands to millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have finally made large-scale use of genetic markers widely available. These methods will be exceedingly valuable for improving tree breeding and understanding the ecological genetics of Douglas-fir, one of the most economically and ecologically important trees in the world. Results We designed SNP assays for 55,766 potential SNPs that were discovered from previous transcriptome sequencing projects. We tested the array on similar to 2300 related and unrelated coastal Douglas-fir trees (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii) from Oregon and Washington, and 13 trees of interior Douglas-fir (P. menziesii var. glauca). As many as similar to 28 K SNPs were reliably genotyped and polymorphic, depending on the selected SNP call rate. To increase the number of SNPs and improve genome coverage, we developed protocols to 'rescue' SNPs that did not pass the default Affymetrix quality control criteria (e.g., 97% SNP call rate). Lowering the SNP call rate threshold from 97 to 60% increased the number of successful SNPs from 20,669 to 28,094. We used a subset of 395 unrelated trees to calculate SNP population genetic statistics for coastal Douglas-fir. Over a range of call rate thresholds (97 to 60%), the median call rate for SNPs in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium ranged from 99.2 to 99.7%, and the median minor allele frequency ranged from 0.198 to 0.233. The successful SNPs also worked well on interior Douglas-fir. Conclusions Based on the original transcriptome assemblies and comparisons to version 1.0 of the Douglas-fir reference genome, we conclude that these SNPs can be used to genotype about 10 K to 15 K loci. The Axiom genotyping array will serve as an excellent foundation for studying the population genomics of Douglas-fir and for implementing genomic selection.

This is because measuring the genetic consequences of habitat loss requires accounting for major methodological limitations like the confounding effect of habitat fragmentation, historical processes underpinning genetic differentiation, time-lags between the onset of disturbances and genetic outcomes, and the need for large numbers of samples, genetic markers, and replicated landscapes to ensure sufficient statistical power. In this paper we overcame all these challenges to assess the genetic consequences of extreme habitat loss driven by mining in two herbs endemic to Amazonian savannas. Relying on genotyping-by-sequencing of hundreds of individuals collected across two mining landscapes, we identified thousands of neutral and independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in each species and used these to evaluate population structure, genetic diversity, and gene flow. Since open-pit mining in our study region rarely involves habitat fragmentation, we were able to assess the independent effect of habitat loss. We also accounted for the underlying population structure when assessing landscape effects on genetic diversity and gene flow, examined the sensitivity of our analyses to the resolution of spatial data, and used annual species and cross-year analyses to minimize and quantify possible time-lag effects. We found that both species are remarkably resilient, as genetic diversity and gene flow patterns were unaffected by habitat loss. Whereas historical habitat amount was found to influence inbreeding; heterozygosity and inbreeding were not affected by habitat loss in either species, and gene flow was mainly influenced by geographic distance, pre-mining land cover, and local climate.

Results The linkage analysis results indicate that intellectual disability in this family is genetically heterogeneous, with suggestive linkage found on chromosomes 1q31-q41, 4q32-q35, 6p25 and 14q24-q31 (LOD scores of 2.4, simulated p-value of 0.000003 and a simulated genome-wide p-value of 0.06). Exome sequencing was then performed in 14 family members and 7 unrelated individuals from the same region. The analysis of coding variation revealed a pathogenic and candidate variants in different branches of the family. In three patients we find a known homozygous pathogenic mutation in the Homo sapiens solute carrier family 17 member 5 (SLC17A5), causing Salla disease. We also identify a deletion overlapping KDM3B and a duplication overlapping MAP3K4 and AGPAT4, both overlapping variants previously reported in developmental disorders. Conclusions DNA samples from the large family analyzed in this study were initially collected based on a hypothesis that affected members shared a major genetic risk factor.

We hypothesized that genomic selection exploits mutational variance less than traditional selection methods such as mass selection or selection on pedigree-based breeding values, because DNM in selection candidates are not captured when the selection candidates' own phenotype is not used in genomic selection, DNM are not on SNP chips and DNM are not in linkage disequilibrium with the SNP on the chip. We tested this hypothesis with Monte Carlo simulation. From whole-genome sequence data, a subset of similar to 300,000 variants was used that served as putative markers, quantitative trait loci or DNM. We simulated 20 generations with truncation selection based on breeding values from genomic best linear unbiased prediction without (GBLUP_no_OP) or with own phenotype (GBLUP_OP), pedigree-based BLUP without (BLUP_no_OP) or with own phenotype (BLUP_OP), or directly on phenotype. GBLUP_OP was the best strategy in exploiting mutational variance, while GBLUP_no_OP and BLUP_no_OP were the worst in exploiting mutational variance. The crucial element is that GBLUP_no_OP and BLUP_no_OP puts no selection pressure on DNM in selection candidates. Genetic variance decreased faster with GBLUP_no_OP and GBLUP_OP than with BLUP_no_OP, BLUP_OP or mass selection. The distribution of mutational effects, mutational variance, number of DNM per individual and nonadditivity had a large impact on mutational selection response and mutational genetic variance, but not on ranking of selection strategies. We advocate that more sustainable genomic selection strategies are required to optimize long-term selection response and to maintain genetic diversity.",NA,NA,"OCT",2019,213,"2",NA,"10.1534/genetics.119.302336",NA,"genetics.119.302336"

Genetic diversity is generally assessed by means of neutral molecular markers, and it is usually quantified by the expected heterozygosity under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and the number of alieles per locus or allelic diversity. These two measures of genetic diversity are complementary because whereas the former is directly related to genetic variance for quantitative traits and, therefore, to the short-term response to selection and adaptation, the latter is more sensitive to population bottlenecks and relates more strongly to the long-term capacity of adaptation of populations. In the context of structured populations undergoing conservation programs, it is important to decide the optimum management strategy to preserve as much genetic diversity as possible while avoiding inbreeding. Here we examine, through computer simulations, the consequences of choosing a conservation strategy based on maximizing either heterozygosity or allelic diversity of single-nucleotide polymorphism haplotypes in a subdivided population. Our results suggest that maximization of allelic diversity can be more efficient in maintaining the genetic diversity of subdivided populations than maximization of expected heterozygosity because the former maintains a larger number of alleles while making a better control of inbreeding. Thus, maximization of allelic diversity should be a recommended strategy in conservation programs for structured populations.",NA,NA,"SEP 13",2019,10,"",NA,"10.3389/fgene.2019.00843",NA,"fgene.2019.00843"

The genomic revolution has opened up opportunities for measuring relatedness among individuals with precision, enabling pedigree-free estimation of trait heritabilities in wild populations. However, until now, most quantitative genetic studies based on a genomic relatedness matrix (GRM) have focused on long-term monitored populations for which traditional pedigrees were also available, and have often had access to knowledge of genome sequence and variability. Here, we investigated the potential of RAD-sequencing for estimating heritability in a free-ranging roe deer (Capreolous capreolus) population for which no prior genomic resources were available. We propose a step-by-step analytical framework to optimize the quality and quantity of the genomic data and explore the impact of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling and filtering processes on the GRM structure and GRM-based heritability estimates. As expected, our results show that sequence coverage strongly affects the number of recovered loci, the genotyping error rate and the amount of missing data. Ultimately, this had little effect on heritability estimates and their standard errors, provided that the GRM was built from a minimum number of loci (above 7,000). Genomic relatedness matrix-based heritability estimates thus appear robust to a moderate level of genotyping errors in the SNP data set. We also showed that quality filters, such as the removal of low-frequency variants, affect the relatedness structure of the GRM, generating lower h(2) estimates. Our work illustrates the huge potential of RAD-sequencing for estimating GRM-based heritability in virtually any natural population.",NA,NA,"SEP",2019,19,"5",NA,"10.1111/1755-0998.13031",NA,"1755-0998.13031"

The bacterium affects coho salmon (CS; Oncorhynchus kisutch), Atlantic salmon (AS; Salmo salar), and rainbow trout (RT; Oncorhynchus mykiss) in several countries, including Norway, Canada, Scotland, Ireland, and Chile. We used Bayesian genome-wide association study analyses to investigate the genetic architecture of resistance to P. salmonis in farmed populations of these species. Resistance to SRS was defined as the number of days to death and as binary survival (BS). A total of 828 CS, 2130 RT, and 2601 AS individuals were phenotyped and then genotyped using double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing and 57K and 50K Affymetrix (R) Axiom (R) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panels, respectively. Both traits of SRS resistance in CS and RT appeared to be under oligogenic control. In AS, there was evidence of polygenic control of SRS resistance. To identify candidate genes associated with resistance, we applied a comparative genomics approach in which we systematically explored the complete set of genes adjacent to SNPs, which explained more than 1% of the genetic variance of resistance in each salmonid species (533 genes in total). Thus, genes were classified based on the following criteria: i) shared function of their protein domains among species, ii) shared orthology among species, iii) proximity to the SNP explaining the highest proportion of the genetic variance, and iv) presence in more than one genomic region explaining more than 1% of the genetic variance within species Our results allowed us to identify 120 candidate genes belonging to at least one of the four criteria described above. Of these, 21 of them were part of at least two of the criteria defined above and are suggested to be strong functional candidates influencing P. salmonis resistance. These genes are related to diverse biological processes, such as kinase activity, GTP hydrolysis, helicase activity, lipid metabolism, cytoskeletal dynamics, inflammation, and innate immune response, which seem essential in the host response against P. salmonis infection.

The strategy of ALStructure is to first estimate the low-dimensional linear subspace of the population admixture components, and then search for a model within this subspace that is consistent with the admixture model's natural probabilistic constraints. Central to this strategy is the observation that all models belonging to this constrained space of solutions are risk-minimizing and have equal likelihood, rendering any additional optimization unnecessary. The low-dimensional linear subspace is estimated through a recently introduced principal components analysis method that is appropriate for genotype data, thereby providing a solution that has both principal components and probabilistic admixture interpretations. Our approach differs fundamentally from other existing methods for estimating admixture, which aim to fit the admixture model directly by searching for parameters that maximize the likelihood function or the posterior probability. We observe that ALStructure typically outperforms existing methods both in accuracy and computational speed under a wide array of simulated and real human genotype datasets. Throughout this work, we emphasize that the admixture model is a special case of a much broader class of models for which algorithms similar to ALStructure may be successfully employed.

We characterized the population structure of P. plurivora in a survey of four Oregon nurseries across three different counties with focus on Rhododendron hosts. Isolates were identified to the species level by Sanger sequencing and/or a PCR-RFLP assay of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. We used genotyping-by-sequencing to determine genetic diversity. Variants were called de novo, resulting in 284 high-quality variants for 61 isolates after stringent filtering. Based on F-st and AMOVA, populations were moderately differentiated among nurseries. Overall, population structure suggested presence of one dominant clonal lineage in all nurseries, as well as isolates of cryptic diversity mostly found in one nursery. Within the clonal lineage, there was a broad range of sensitivity to mefenoxam and phosphorous acid. Sensitivity of the two fungicides was correlated. P. plurivora was previously assumed to spread clonally, and the low genotypic diversity observed within and among isolates corroborated this hypothesis.

Lumbar disc degeneration (LDD) may be a contributing factor for LBP. Modic change (MC), a distinct phenotype of LDD, is presented as a pathological bone marrow signal change adjacent to vertebral endplate on MRI. It is strongly associated with LBP and has heritability around 30%. Our objective was to identify genetic loci associated with MC using a genome-wide meta-analysis. Methods Presence of MC was evaluated in lumbar MRI in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (n=1182) and TwinsUK (n=647). Genome-wide association analyses were carried out using linear regression model. Inverse-variance weighting approach was used in the meta-analysis. Results A locus associated with MC (p<5e-8) was found on chromosome 9 with the lead SNP rs1934268 in an intron of the PTPRD gene. It is located in the binding region of BCL11A, SPI1 and PBX3 transcription factors. The SNP was nominally associated with LBP in TwinsUK (p=0.001) but not associated in the UK Biobank (p=0.914). Suggestive signals (p<1e-5) were identified near XKR4, SCIN, MGMT, DLG2, ZNF184 and OPRK1.

However, there is as yet no overall picture on genetic variations and population structure of this species, which is important for its aquaculture.ResultsWe used 43,310 SNPs to infer the population structure, evidence of local adaptation and sources of introduction.

The native populations were differentiated into three genetic clusters, corresponding to the Yangtze, Pearl and Heilongjiang River Systems, respectively. The populations in Malaysia, India and Nepal were introduced from both the Yangtze and Pearl River Systems. Loci and genes involved in putative local selection for native locations were identified. Evidence of both positive and balancing selection was found in the introduced locations. Genes associated with loci under putative selection were involved in many biological functions.

Several aspects of chronic pain, for example back pain and a severity-related phenotype chronic pain grade', have been shown previously to be complex heritable traits with a polygenic component. Additional pain-related phenotypes capturing aspects of an individual's overall sensitivity to experiencing and reporting chronic pain have also been suggested as a focus for investigation. We made use of a measure of the number of sites of chronic pain in individuals within the UK general population. This measure, termed Multisite Chronic Pain (MCP), is a complex trait and its genetic architecture has not previously been investigated. To address this, we carried out a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) of MCP in similar to 380,000 UK Biobank participants. Our findings were consistent with MCP having a significant polygenic component, with a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) heritability of 10.2%. In total 76 independent lead SNPs at 39 risk loci were associated with MCP. Additional gene-level association analyses identified neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, nervous system development, cell-cycle progression and apoptosis genes as enriched for genetic association with MCP. Genetic correlations were observed between MCP and a range of psychiatric, autoimmune and anthropometric traits, including major depressive disorder (MDD), asthma and Body Mass Index (BMI). Furthermore, in Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses a causal effect of MCP on MDD was observed. Additionally, a polygenic risk score (PRS) for MCP was found to significantly predict chronic widespread pain (pain all over the body), indicating the existence of genetic variants contributing to both of these pain phenotypes. Overall, our findings support the proposition that chronic pain involves a strong nervous system component with implications for our understanding of the physiology of chronic pain. These discoveries may also inform the future development of novel treatment approaches.

In this study we searched for genetic variants associated with chronic pain in a large general-population cohort. We also assessed how this genetic variation was correlated with a range of other diseases and traits, such as depression and BMI, and we tested for causal relationships between depression and chronic pain. We found that chronic pain was associated with several genes involved in brain function and development and was correlated with mental health and autoimmune traits (including depression, PTSD and asthma).

The aim of this paper is to propose a novel Bayesian framework for hierarchical variable selection at both SNP-set (group) level and SNP (within group) level. We overcome a key limitation of existing posterior updating scheme in most Bayesian variable selection methods by proposing a novel sampling scheme to explicitly accommodate the ultrahigh-dimensionality of genetic data. Specifically, by constructing an auxiliary variable selection model under SNP-set level, the new procedure utilizes the posterior samples of the auxiliary model to subsequently guide the posterior inference for the targeted hierarchical selection model. We apply the proposed method to a variety of simulation studies and show that our method is computationally efficient and achieves substantially better performance than competing approaches in both SNP-set and SNP selection.

To overcome this problem, we explored the possibility to link the variation in a key clock property, circadian period (Tau), to genetic variation. We measured Tau in 152 captive great tits (Parus major). We further linked Tau to two circadian phase markers, the onset of activity in the Light:Dark cycle, and the first onset in constant conditions (Dim:Dim), directly after entrainment.

Pathway-based association analyses were performed using a modified Gene Set Enrichment Algorithm (GSEA) (GenGen program) to further explore BMI-related pathways using our genome wide association study (GWAS) data set, GIANT, ENGAGE, and DIAGRAM Consortia. Results: The EXOC4-1q23.1 interaction was associated with BMI, with the most significant epistasis between rs7800006 and rs10797020 (P = 2.63 x 10(-11)). In the pathway-based association analysis, Tob1 pathway showed the most significant association with BMI (empirical P < 0.001, FDR = 0.044, FWER = 0.040). These findings were further validated in different populations. Conclusion: Genome-wide pairwise SNP-SNP interaction and pathway analyses suggest that EXOC4 and TOB1-related pathways may contribute to the development of obesity.",NA,NA,"MAY 1",2019,10,"",NA,"10.3389/fgene.2019.00404",NA,"fgene.2019.00404"

The aim was to identify such regulatory elements in the human liver to understand the genetics behind type 2 diabetes and metabolic diseases. Methods: The genome of liver tissue was sequenced using 10X Genomics technology to call polymorphic positions. Using ChIP-seq for two histone modifications, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, and the transcription factor CTCF, and our established bioinformatics pipeline, we detected sites with significant difference in signal between the alleles.

In GWAS, there is a need to consider confounding effects such as due to population structure, and take groups of SNPs into account simultaneously due to the polygenic attribute of complex quantitative traits. In this paper, we propose a new approach SGL-LMM that puts together sparse group lasso (SGL) and linear mixed model (LMM) for multivariate associations of quantitative traits. LMM, as has been often used in GWAS, controls for confounders, while SGL maintains sparsity of the underlying multivariate regression model. SGL-LMM first sets a fixed zero effect to learn the parameters of random effects using LMM, and then estimates fixed effects using SGL regularization. We present efficient algorithms for hyperparameter tuning and feature selection using stability selection. While controlling for confounders and constraining for sparse solutions, SGL-LMM also provides a natural framework for incorporating prior biological information into the group structure underlying the model. Results based on both simulated and real data show SGL-LMM outperforms previous approaches in terms of power to detect associations and accuracy of quantitative trait prediction.",NA,NA,"APR 10",2019,10,"",NA,"10.3389/fgene.2019.00271",NA,"fgene.2019.00271"

The breed has great potential in meeting demands of local food producers, commercial farmers and biotechnology sector of specific pathogen-free (SPF) eggs, the former valuing the breed for its egg weight (EW), EL, age at first egg (AFE), body weight (BW), and the latter for its yield of extraembryonic fluid (YEF) in 12.5-day embryos, ratio of extraembryonic fluid to egg weight, and embryo mass.

Genetic factors underlying VVs development remain largely unknown. Here we report the first large-scale study of VVs performed on a freely available genetic data of 408,455 European-ancestry individuals. We identified the 12 reliably associated loci that explain 13% of the SNP-based heritability, and prioritized the most likely causal genes CASZ1, PIEZO1, PPP3R1, EBF1, STIM2, HFE, GATA2, NFATC2, and SOX9. VVs-associated variants within these loci exhibited pleiotropic effects on several phenotypes including blood pressure/hypertension and blood cell traits. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed gene categories related to abnormal vasculogenesis. Genetic correlation analysis confirmed known epidemiological associations between VVs and deep venous thrombosis, weight, rough labor, and standing job, and found a genetic overlap with multiple traits that have not been previously suspected to share common genetic background with VVs. These traits included educational attainment, fluid intelligence and prospective memory scores, walking pace (negative correlation with VVs), smoking, height, number of operations, pain, and gonarthrosis (positive correlation with VVs). Finally, Mendelian randomization analysis provided evidence for causal effects of plasma levels of MICB and CD209 proteins, and anthropometric traits such as waist and hip circumference, height, weight, and both fat and fat-free mass. Our results provide novel insight into both VVs genetics and etiology. The revealed genes and proteins can be considered as good candidates for follow-up functional studies and might be of interest as potential drug targets. Author summary Varicose veins of lower extremities (VVs) affect about 30% of adults in developed countries and cause both cosmetic and health problems. A strong body of evidence indicates that heredity plays an important role in the etiology of this condition. However, genetic basis of VVs remains poorly understood. Here, we present the results of the first large-scale genetic study for VVs. We identified genes which are the most likely involved in VVs pathogenesis. We show that VVs are correlated at a genetic level with numerous traits and phenotypes, including those already known from prior epidemiological studies (deep venous thrombosis, body mass index, standing job, etc.) as well as with those that have not been suspected to share common genetic background with VVs (fluid intelligence and prospective memory scores, smoking, walking pace, pain all over the body, and other traits). Finally, using genetic variants as instruments, we demonstrate direct causal effects of the traits related to anthropometry, such as height and weight, and plasma levels of immune-related proteins MICB and CD209.

Many chromosomal regions harboring effects on quantitative traits have been reported from these studies, but the underlying causative mutations remain mostly undetected. In this study, we combine large genotype and phenotype data available from a commercial pig breeding scheme for three different breeds (Duroc, Landrace, and Large White) to pinpoint functional variation for a region on porcine chromosome 7 affecting number of teats (NTE). Our results show that refining trait definition by counting number of vertebrae (NVE) and ribs (RIB) helps to reduce noise from other genetic variation and increases heritability from 0.28 up to 0.62 NVE and 0.78 RIB in Duroc. However, in Landrace, the effect of the same QTL on NTE mainly affects NVE and not RIB, which is reflected in reduced heritability for RIB (0.24) compared to NVE (0.59). Further, differences in allele frequencies and accuracy of rib counting influence genetic parameters. Correction for the top SNP does not detect any other QTL effect on NTE, NVE, or RIB in Landrace or Duroc. At the molecular level, haplotypes derived from 660K SNP data detects a core haplotype of seven SNPs in Duroc. Sequence analysis of 16 Duroc animals shows that two functional mutations of the Vertnin (VRTN) gene known to increase number of thoracic vertebrae (ribs) reside on this haplotype. In Landrace, the linkage disequilibrium (LD) extends over a region of more than 3 Mb also containing both VRTN mutations. Here, other modifying loci are expected to cause the breed-specific effect. Additional variants found on the wildtype haplotype surrounding the VRTN region in all sequenced Landrace animals point toward breed specific differences which are expected to be present also across the whole genome. This Landrace specific haplotype contains two missense mutations in the ABCD4 gene, one of which is expected to have a negative effect on the protein function.

Still, the population specific features of the locus structure have not been approached in detail.MethodsWe analyzed the population specific haplotype profiles of FTO genomic locus identified by Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) for the high obesity risk by examining eighteen 1000G populations from 4 continental groups. The GWAS SNPs cluster is located in the FTO gene intron 1 spanning around 70kb.ResultsWe reconstructed the ancestral state of the locus, which comprised low-risk major allele found in all populations, and two minor risk-associated alleles, each one specific for African and European populations, correspondingly. The locus structure and its allele frequency distribution underscore the high risk allele frequency specifically for the European population. South Asian populations have the second highest frequency of risk alleles, while East Asian populations have the lowest. African population-specific minor allele was only partially risk-associated. All of the GWAS SNPs considered are manifested by low risk alleles as reference (major) ones (p>0.5) in each of the continental groups. Strikingly, rs1421085, recently reported as a causal SNP, was found to be monomorphic in ancestral (African) populations, implying possible selection sweep in the course of its rapid fixation, as reported previously.ConclusionThe observations underscore varying FTO -linked risk in the manifestation of population specific epidemiology of genetically bound obesity.

Conservation of the species, and the expansion of aquaculture requires the development of genetic tools to study polymorphism, differentiation, and stock structure. This study aimed to investigate genomic polymorphism through ddRAD sequencing, in order to identify a panel of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and to simultaneously assess genetic diversity and structure in wild (from rivers Amazon, Solimoes, Tocantins and Araguaia) and captive populations.ResultsCompared to many other teleosts, the degree of polymorphism in A. gigas was low with only 2.3% of identified RAD-tags (135 bases long) containing SNPs. A panel of 393 informative SNPs was identified and screened across the five populations. Higher genetic diversity indices (number of polymorphic loci and private alleles, Shannon's Index and H-O) were found in populations from the Amazon and Solimoes, intermediate levels in Tocantins and Captive, and very low levels in the Araguaia population. These results likely reflect larger population sizes from less urbanized environments in the Amazon basin compared to Araguaia. Populations were significantly differentiated with pairwise F-ST values ranging from 0.086 (Amazon x Solimoes) to 0.556 (Amazon x Araguaia). Mean pairwise relatedness among individuals was significant in all populations (P<0.01), reflecting a degree of inbreeding possibly due to severe depletion of natural stocks, the species sedentary behaviour and possible sampling biases. Although Mantel test was not significant (P=0.104; R-2=0.65), Bayesian analysis in STRUCTURE and discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) showed populations of Amazon and Solimoes to be genetically differentiated from Araguaia, with Tocantins comprising individuals from both identified stocks.ConclusionsThis relatively rapid genotyping by sequencing approach proved to be successful in delineating arapaima stocks.

During the last decade, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has offered advanced techniques for efficiently identifying microsatellite markers and accurately genotyping samples. Here, we identify new microsatellite markers for the tree of heaven by applying an NGS-based method using the Illumina MiSeq platform. NGS technology was proved to be an effective method for fast and cost-efficient identification of microsatellite markers by implementing a genotyping-by-sequencing approach based on Illumina amplicon sequencing (SSR-GBS). We screened three populations from Eastern Austria for genetic variation at 19 newly identified microsatellite loci. We tested two different genotyping approaches: (1) considering only allele lengths (forming a so-called allele length dataset), (2) taking also single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the amplified fragments into account (forming a so-called SNP dataset). The results revealed higher values for all genetic diversity parameters, as well as a better resolution of genetic assignment, when the latter approach was followed. Thus, by taking advantage of sequence information which is provided by SSR-GBS, one may achieve considerable gains in performance using the same marker set.

The significant SNPs were entered into the second phase, where a mixed logistic model incorporated the community disease risk factors together with the individual factors as the fixed part of the model and the geographic region as a random effect.ResultsAnalysis of 1489 subjects (26.9% HDL-C dyslipidemia) identified rs3758539, a non-coding variant in the 5'UTR of RBP4, to be associated with HDL-C dyslipidemia (odds ratio=1.45, 95% confidence interval=1.08-1.97, p=0.01). The association remained significant, and the effect size did not change after the incorporation of individual and community risk factors from 17 geographic regions (odds ratio: 1.41, 95% confidence interval=1.03-1.93, p=0.03) in NL. Besides this variant, sex, BMI, and smoking also showed significant associations with HDL-C dyslipidemia, whereas no role was identified for the community factors.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates the use of community-level data in a genetic association testing.

We also examined the potential impact of these polymorphisms on the plasma level of soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE), a decoy receptor whose reduction has been associated with a higher risk of AD. Additionally, a meta-analysis was performed using the present study and the largest GWAS from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP). No significant differences were found in the distributions of genotypes or alleles between AD patients and control subjects. However, age-at-onset stratification analysis revealed that there were significant differences in the genotypes (P = 0.015) and alleles (P = 0.006) of the rs653765 SNP. Furthermore, patients with the rs653765 CC genotype showed a lower ADAM10 level and a faster cognitive deterioration than those in patients with the CT/TT genotype in late-onset AD (LOAD), and the rs653765 CC polymorphism was able to regulate the production of the ADAM10 substrate sRAGE.

For Mexican gray wolf, we conducted parentage analyses for 30 pups from a single cohort where samples were available from 64% of possible mothers and 53% of possible fathers, and the accuracy of parentage assignments could be estimated because true identities of parents were known a priori based on field data. For bighorn sheep, we conducted maternity analyses for 39 lambs from five cohorts where 77% of possible mothers were sampled, but true identities of parents were unknown. Analyses with and without a reference genome produced SNP panels with >= 95% parentage assignment accuracy for Mexican gray wolf, outperforming microsatellites at 78% accuracy. Maternity assignments were completely consistent across all SNP panels for the bighorn sheep, and were 74.4% consistent with assignments from microsatellites.

Moreover, facial features clearly differ between males and females, and these differences are driven primarily by the influence of sex hormones during growth and development. Specific genetic variants are known to influence circulating sex hormone levels in humans, which we hypothesize, in turn, affect facial features. In this study, we investigated the effects of testosterone-related genetic variants on facial morphology. We tested 32 genetic variants across 22 candidate genes related to levels of testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHGB) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) in three cohorts of healthy individuals for which 3D facial surface images were available (Pittsburgh 3DFN, Penn State and ALSPAC cohorts; total n = 7418). Facial shape was described using a recently developed extension of the dense-surface correspondence approach, in which the 3D facial surface was partitioned into a set of 63 hierarchically organized modules. Each variant was tested against each of the facial surface modules in a multivariate genetic association-testing framework and meta-analyzed. Additionally, the association between these candidate SNPs and five facial ratios was investigated in the Pittsburgh 3DFN cohort. Two significant associations involving intronic variants of SHBG were found: both rs12150660 (p = 1.07E-07) and rs1799941 (p = 6.15E-06) showed an effect on mandible shape.

In this paper, we describe the development of a genotyping array containing more than 58,000 SNPs for Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). SNPs were identified from whole genome resequencing of 32 individuals from the commercial population of the Genomar strain, and were selected for the SNP-array based on polymorphic information content and physical distribution across the genome using the Oreni11.1 genome assembly as reference sequence. SNP-performance was evaluated by genotyping 4991 individuals, including 689 offspring belonging to 41 full-sib families, which revealed high-quality genotype data for 43,588 SNPs. A preliminary genetic linkage map was constructed using Lepmap2 which in turn was integrated with information from the O_niloticus_UMD1 genome assembly to produce an integrated physical and genetic linkage map comprising 40,186 SNPs distributed across 22 linkage groups (LGs). Around one-third of the LGs showed a different recombination rate between sexes, with the female being greater than the male map by a factor of 1.2 (1632.9 to 1359.6 cM, respectively), with most LGs displaying a sigmoid recombination profile. Finally, the sex-determining locus was mapped to position 40.53 cM on LG23, in the vicinity of the anti-Mullerian hormone (amh) gene.

Annual catches in commercial fisheries are in serious decline, which has resulted in calls for the development of an integrated stock management approach. In Oman, the scalloped spiny lobster is currently treated as a single management unit (MU) or stock and there is an absence of information on the genetic population structure of the species that can inform management decisions, particularly at a fine-scale level. This work is the first to identify genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for P. homarus using Diversity Arrays Technology sequencing (DArT-seq) and to elucidate any stock structure in the species. Results: After stringent filtering, 7988 high utility SNPs were discovered and used to assess the genetic diversity, connectivity and structure of P. homarus populations from Al Ashkharah, Masirah Island, Duqm, Ras Madrakah, Haitam, Ashuwaymiyah, Mirbat and Dhalkut landing sites. Pairwise F-ST estimates revealed low differentiation among populations (pairwise F-ST range = - 0.0008 - 0.0021). Analysis of genetic variation using putatively directional F-ST outliers (504 SNPs) revealed higher and significant pairwise differentiation (p < 0.01) for all locations, with Ashuwaymiyah being the most diverged population (Ashuwaymiyah pairwise FST range = 0.0288-0.0736). Analysis of population structure using Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC) revealed a broad admixture among P. homarus, however, Ashuwaymiyah stock appeared to be potentially under local adaptive pressures. Fine scale analysis using Netview R provided further support for the general admixture of P. homarus. Conclusions: Findings here suggested that stocks of P. homarus along the Omani coastline are admixed. Yet, fishery managers need to treat the lobster stock from Ashuwaymiyah with caution as it might be subject to local adaptive pressures.

Fireflies vary in their light signal color both within and between species, and thus provide an excellent system in which to study signal production and reception in the context of signaling environments. Differences in signal color have been hypothesized to be due to variation in the sequence of luciferase, the enzyme that catalyzes the light reaction. Similarly, differences in visual sensitivity, which are expected to match signal color, have been hypothesized to be due to variation in the sequence of opsins, the protein component of visual pigments. Here we investigated (1) whether sequence variation in luciferase correlates with variation in signal color and (2) whether sequence variation in opsins correlates with inferred matching visual sensitivity across populations of a widespread North American firefly species, Photinus pyralis. We further tested (3) whether selection has acted on these loci by examining their population-level differentiation relative to the distribution of differentiation derived from a genome-wide sample of loci generated by double-digest RADseq. Results: We found virtually no coding variation in luciferase or opsins. However, there was extreme divergence in non-coding variation in luciferase across populations relative to a panel of random genomic loci. Conclusions: The absence of protein variation at both loci challenges the paradigm that variation in signal color and visual sensitivity in fireflies is exclusively due to coding variation in luciferase and opsin genes. Instead, flash color variation within species must involve other mechanisms, such as abdominal pigmentation or regulation of light organ physiology.

Both bees are important for biological and economic reasons. First, A.m. scutellata is the invasive African honey bee of the Americas and exhibits a number of traits that beekeepers consider undesirable. They swarm excessively, are prone to absconding (vacating the nest entirely), usurp other honey bee colonies, and exhibit heightened defensiveness. Second, Cape honey bees are socially parasitic bees; the workers can reproduce thelytokously. Both bees are indistinguishable visually. Therefore, we employed Genotyping-by-Sequencing (GBS), wing geometry and standard morphometric approaches to assess the genetic diversity and population structure of these bees to search for diagnostic markers that can be employed to distinguish between the two subspecies. Results: Apis mellifera scutellata possessed the highest mean number of polymorphic SNPs (among 2449 informative SNPs) with minor allele frequencies > 0.05 (Np = 88%). The RSA honey bees generated a high level of expected heterozygosity (H-exp = 0.24). The mean genetic differentiation (F-ST; 6.5%) among the RSA honey bees revealed that approximately 93% of the genetic variation was accounted for within individuals of these subspecies. Two genetically distinct clusters (K = 2) corresponding to both subspecies were detected by Model-based Bayesian clustering and supported by Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) inferences. Selected highly divergent loci (n = 83) further reinforced a distinctive clustering of two subspecies across geographical origins, accounting for approximately 83% of the total variation in the PCoA plot. The significant correlation of allele frequencies at divergent loci with environmental variables suggested that these populations are adapted to local conditions. Only 17 of 48 wing geometry and standard morphometric parameters were useful for clustering A.m. capensis, A.m. scutellata, and hybrid individuals. Conclusions: We produced a minimal set of 83 SNP loci and 17 wing geometry and standard morphometric parameters useful for identifying the two RSA honey bee subspecies by genotype and phenotype.

We also found evidence for population structuring, with four main Antarctic island groups being resolved. Finally, appreciable variance in individual inbreeding could be detected, reflecting the strong polygyny and site fidelity of the species.

This group of 1187 individuals represented 177 full-sib families with 1-49 sibs per family, which were challenged with virulent Phdp for a duration of 18 days, and mortalities were recorded within this duration. Tissue samples were collected from the parents and the recorded offspring for DNA extraction, library preparation using 2b-RAD and genotyping by sequencing. Genotypic data was used to develop a linkage map, genome wide association analysis and for the estimation of breeding values. Results: The analysis of genetic variation for resistance against Phdp revealed moderate genomic heritability with estimates of similar to 0.32. A genome-wide association analysis revealed a quantitative trait locus (QTL) including 11 SNPs at linkage group 17 presenting significant association to the trait with p-value crossing genome-wide Bonferroni corrected threshold P <= 2.22e-06.

There has been no prior genomewide association study of breast milk, hence our objective was to test for genetic association with breast milk FA composition. Methods We measured the fractional composition of 26 individual FAs in breast milk samples from three cohorts totalling 1142 Bangladeshi mothers whose infants were genotyped on the IIIumina MEGA chip and replicated on a custom Affymetrix 30K SNP array (n=616). Maternal genotypes were imputed using IMPUTE. Results After running 33 separate FA fraction phenotypes, we found that SNPs known to be associated with serum FAs in the FADS1/2/3 region were also associated with breast milk FA composition (experiment-wise significance threshold 4.2X10-(9)). Hypothesis-neutral comparison of the 33 fractions showed that the most significant genetic association at the FADS1/2/3 locus was with fraction of arachidonic acid (AA) at SNP rs 174556, with a very large per major allele effect size of 17% higher breast milk AA level. There was no evidence of independent association at FADS1/2/3 with any other FA or SNP after conditioning on AA and rs 174556.

Recently we have performed high coverage whole genome resequencing with 61 unrelated samples, representing a wide range of rainbow trout and steelhead populations, with 49 new samples added to 12 aquaculture samples from AquaGen (Norway) that we previously used for SNP discovery. Of the 49 new samples, 11 were double-haploid lines from Washington State University (WSU) and 38 represented wild and hatchery populations from a wide range of geographic distribution and with divergent migratory phenotypes. We then mapped the sequences to the new rainbow trout reference genome assembly (GCA_002163495.1) which is based on the Swanson YY doubled haploid line. Variant calling was conducted with FreeBayes and SAMtools mpileup, followed by filtering of SNPs based on quality score, sequence complexity, read depth on the locus, and number of genotyped samples. Results from the two variant calling programs were compared and genotypes of the double haploid samples were used for detecting and filtering putative paralogous sequence variants (PSVs) and multi-sequence variants (MSVs). Overall, 30,302,087 SNPs were identified on the rainbow trout genome 29 chromosomes and 1,139,018 on unplaced scaffolds, with 4,042,723 SNPs having high minor allele frequency (MAF > 0.25). The average SNP density on the chromosomes was one SNP per 64 bp, or 15.6 SNPs per 1 kb. Results from the phylogenetic analysis that we conducted indicate that the SNP markers contain enough population-specific polymorphisms for recovering population relationships despite the small sample size used. Intra-Population polymorphism assessment revealed high level of polymorphism and heterozygosity within each population.

For example, although multiple population genetics studies of the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) have been conducted, no similar studies have been done of the closely-related prairie falcon (F. mexicanus) and it is unclear how much genetic variation and population structure exists across the species' range. Furthermore, the phylogenetic relationship of F. mexicanus relative to other falcon species is contested. We utilized a genomics approach (i.e., genome sequencing and assembly followed by single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping) to rapidly address these gaps in knowledge. Results: We sequenced the genome of a single female prairie falcon and generated a 1.17 Gb (gigabases) draft genome assembly. We generated maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees using complete mitochondrial genomes as well as nuclear protein-coding genes. This process provided evidence that F. mexicanus is an outgroup to the clade that includes the peregrine falcon and members of the subgenus Hierofalco. We annotated > 16,000 genes and almost 600,000 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the nuclear genome, providing the raw material for a SNP assay design featuring > 140 gene-associated markers and a molecular-sexing marker. We subsequently genotyped similar to 100 individuals from California (including the San Francisco East Bay Area, Pinnacles National Park and the Mojave Desert) and Idaho (Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area). We tested for population structure and found evidence that individuals sampled in California and Idaho represent a single panmictic population. Conclusions: Our study illustrates how genomic resources can rapidly shed light on genetic variability in understudied species and resolve phylogenetic relationships. Furthermore, we found evidence of a single, randomly mating population of prairie falcons across our sampling locations. Prairie falcons are highly mobile and relatively rare long-distance dispersal events may promote gene flow throughout the range. As such, California's prairie falcons might be managed as a single population, indicating that management actions undertaken to benefit the species at the local level have the potential to influence the species as a whole.",NA,NA,"APR 4",2018,19,"",NA,"10.1186/s12864-018-4615-z",NA,"s12864-018-4615-z"

While various factors impact on the severity of outbreaks, it is clear that genetic resistance of the host is an important determinant of mortality levels. This raises the possibility of selective breeding strategies to improve the genetic resistance of farmed oyster stocks, thereby contributing to disease control. Traditional selective breeding can be augmented by use of genetic markers, either via marker-assisted or genomic selection. The aim of the current study was to investigate the genetic architecture of resistance to OsHV in Pacific oyster, to identify genomic regions containing putative resistance genes, and to inform the use of genomics to enhance efforts to breed for resistance. To achieve this, a population of approximate to 1,000 juvenile oysters were experimentally challenged with a virulent form of OsHV, with samples taken from mortalities and survivors for genotyping and qPCR measurement of viral load. The samples were genotyped using a recently-developed SNP array, and the genotype data were used to reconstruct the pedigree. Using these pedigree and genotype data, the first high density linkage map was constructed for Pacific oyster, containing 20,353 SNPs mapped to the ten pairs of chromosomes. Genetic parameters for resistance to OsHV were estimated, indicating a significant but low heritability for the binary trait of survival and also for viral load measures (h2 0.12 - 0.25). A genome-wide association study highlighted a region of linkage group 6 containing a significant QTL affecting host resistance.

Linear mixed model estimation of SNP-heritability uses the structures of genomic relationships between individuals, which is constructed from genome-wide sets of SNP-markers that are generally weighted equally in their contributions. Proposed methods to handle dependence between SNPs include, thinning the marker set by linkage disequilibrium (LD)-pruning, the use of haplotype-tagging of SNPs, and LD-weighting of the SNP-contributions. For improved estimation, we propose a new conceptual framework for genomic relationship matrix, in which Mahalanobis distance-based LD-correction is used in a linear mixed model estimation of SNP-heritability. The superiority of the presented method is illustrated and compared to mixed-model analyses using a VanRaden genomic relationship matrix, a matrix used by GCTA and a matrix employing LD-weighting (as implemented in the LDAK software) in simulated (using real human, rice and cattle genotypes) and real (maize, rice and mice) datasets.

The aim of this project was to characterize the prevalence, the phenotype, and the underlying genetics of crossed beaks in Appenzeller Barthuhn chickens. Results: The estimated prevalence of 7% crossed beaks in Appenzeller Barthuhn was significantly higher compared to two other local Swiss chicken breeds. A breeding trial showed significantly higher prevalence of offspring with deformed beaks from mating of affected parents compared to mating of non-affected parents. Examination of 77 Appenzeller Barthuhn chickens with crossed beaks showed a variable phenotype presentation. The deviation of the beak from the median plane through the head ranged from 1 degrees to 61 degrees. In more than 60% of the cases, the upper and lower beak were bent in the same direction, whereas the remaining cases showed different forms of crossed beaks. Computed tomographic scans and bone maceration of the head of two chickens with crossed beaks revealed that the maxilla and the mandibula were affected, while other parts of the skull appeared to be normal. The gene LOC426217, a member of the keratin family, was postulated as a candidate gene for beak deformity in domestic chickens.

The fungi promote plant diversity and have a potentially important role in global agriculture. Plant growth depends on both inter-and intra-specific variation in AMF. It was recently reported that an unusually large number of AMF taxa have an intercontinental distribution, suggesting long-distance gene flow for many AMF species, facilitated by either long-distance natural dispersal mechanisms or human-assisted dispersal. However, the intercontinental distribution of AMF species has been questioned because the use of very low-resolution markers may be unsuitable to detect genetic differences among geographically separated AMF, as seen with some other fungi. This has been untestable because of the lack of population genomic data, with high resolution, for any AMF taxa. Here we use phylogenetics and population genomics to test for intra-specific variation in Rhizophagus irregularis, an AMF species for which genome sequence information already exists. We used ddRAD sequencing to obtain thousands of markers distributed across the genomes of 81 R. irregularis isolates and related species. Based on 6 888 variable positions, we observed significant genetic divergence into four main genetic groups within R. irregularis, highlighting that previous studies have not captured underlying genetic variation. Despite considerable genetic divergence, surprisingly, the variation could not be explained by geographical origin, thus also supporting the hypothesis for at least one AMF species of widely dispersed AMF genotypes at an intercontinental scale.

This study explored methods to create an ideal reference population for imputation to Next Generation Sequencing data in cattle. Methods: Methods for clustering of animals for imputation were explored, using 1000 Bull Genomes Project sequence data on 1146 animals from a variety of beef and dairy breeds. Imputation from 50 K to 777 K was first carried out to choose an ideal clustering method, using ADMIXTURE or PLINK clustering algorithms with either genotypes or reconstructed haplotypes. Results: Due to efficiency, accuracy and ease of use, clustering with PLINK using haplotypes as quasi-genotypes was chosen as the most advantageous grouping method. It was found that using a clustered population slightly decreased computing time, while maintaining accuracy across the population. Although overall accuracy remained the same, a slight increase in accuracy was observed for groups of animals in some breeds (primarily purebred beef cattle from breeds with fewer sequenced animals) and for other groups, primarily crossbreed animals, a slight decrease in accuracy was observed. However, it was noted that some animals in each breed were poorly imputed across all methods. When imputed sequences were included in the reference population to aid imputation of poorly imputed animals, a small increase in overall accuracy was observed for nearly every individual in the population. Two models were created to predict imputation accuracy, a complete model using all information available including Euclidean distances from genotypes and haplotypes, pedigree information, and clustering groups and a simple model using only breed and an Euclidean distance matrix as predictors. Both models were successful in predicting imputation accuracy, with correlations between predicted and true imputation accuracy as measured by concordance rate of 0.87 and 0.83, respectively.

Given the high incidence of tendon and ligament injuries in elite rugby athletes, we hypothesised that both SNPs would be associated with career success. Results: In 1105 participants (RugbyGene project), comprising 460 elite rugby union (RU), 88 elite rugby league athletes and 565 non-athlete controls, DNA was collected and genotyped for the COL5A1 rs12722 and rs3196378 variants using real-time PCR. For rs12722, the injury-protective CC genotype and C allele were more common in all athletes (21% and 47%, respectively) and RU athletes (22% and 48%) than in controls (16% and 41%, P <= 0.01). For rs3196378, the CC genotype and C allele were overrepresented in all athletes (23% and 48%) and RU athletes (24% and 49%) compared with controls (16% and 41%, P <= 0.02). The CC genotype in particular was overrepresented in the back and centres (24%) compared with controls, with more than twice the odds (OR = 2.25, P = 0.006) of possessing the injury-protective CC genotype. Furthermore, when considering both SNPs simultaneously, the CC-CC SNP-SNP combination and C-C inferred allele combination were higher in all the athlete groups (>= 18% and >= 43%) compared with controls (13% and 40%; P = 0.01). However, no genotype differences were identified for either SNP when RU playing positions were compared directly with each other. Conclusion: It appears that the C alleles, CC genotypes and resulting combinations of both rs12722 and rs3196378 are beneficial for rugby athletes to achieve elite status and carriage of these variants may impart an inherited resistance against soft tissue injury, despite exposure to the high-risk environment of elite rugby.

Although usually present at low-frequency in populations, the impact on individual fitness can be substantial. Until recently, the presence of recessive embryonic lethal variation could only be measured indirectly through reduced fertility. In this study, we estimate the presence of genetic loci associated with both early and late termination of development during gestation in pigs from the wealth of genome data routinely generated by a commercial breeding company. Results: We examined three commercial pig (Sus scrofa) populations for potentially deleterious genetic variation based on 80 K SNP-chip genotypes, and estimate the effects on reproductive traits. 24,000 pigs from three populations were analyzed for missing or depletion of homozygous haplotypes. We identified 145 haplotypes (ranging from 0.5-4 Mb in size) in the genome with complete absence or depletion of homozygous animals. Thirty-five haplotypes show a negative effect on at least one of the analysed reproductive traits (total number born, number of stillborn, and number of mummified piglets). One variant in particular appeared to result in relative late termination of development of fetuses, responsible for a significant fraction of observed stillborn piglets ('mummies'), as they die mid-gestation. Moreover, we identified the BMPER gene as a likely candidate underlying this phenomenon. Conclusions: Our study shows that although lethal recessive variation is present, the frequency of these alleles is invariably low in these highly managed populations. Nevertheless, due to cumulative effects of deleterious variants, large numbers of affected offspring are produced. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the use of a large-scale commercial genetic experiment to systematically screen for 'natural knockouts' that can increase understanding of gene function.",NA,NA,"NOV 9",2017,18,"",NA,"10.1186/s12864-017-4278-1",NA,"s12864-017-4278-1"

We searched for specific characteristics of HWE-departure due to genotyping error. Methods: Genotypes of a random set of genetic variants were obtained from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database. Variants with <80% successful genotypes or with minor allele frequency (MAF) <1% were excluded. HWE-departure (d-HWE) was considered significant at p < 10E-05 and classified as d-HWE with loss of heterozygosity (LoH d-HWE) or d-HWE with excess heterozygosity (gain of heterozygosity: GoH d-HWE). Missing genotypes, variant type (single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) vs. insertion/deletion); MAF, standard deviation (SD) of MAF across populations (MAF-SD) and copy number variation were evaluated for association with HWE-departure. Results: The study sample comprised 3,204 genotype distributions. HWE-departure was observed in 134 variants: LoH d-HWE in 41 (1.3%), GoH d-HWE in 93 (2.9%) variants. LoH d-HWE was more likely in variants located within deletion polymorphisms (p < 0.001) and in variants with higher MAF-SD (p = 0.0077). GoH d-HWE was associated with low genotyping rate, with variants of insertion/deletion type and with high MAF (all at p < 0.001). In a sub-sample of 2,196 variants with genotyping rate >98%, LoH d-HWE was found in 29 (1.3%) variants, but no GoH d-HWE was detected. The findings of the non-random distribution of HWE-violating SNPs along the chromosome, the association with common deletion polymorphisms and indel-variant type, and the finding of excess heterozygotes in genomic regions that are prone to cross-hybridization were confirmed in a large sample of short variants from the 1,000 Genomes Project. Conclusions: We differentiated between two types of HWE-departure. GoH d-HWE was suggestive for genotyping error.

The aim of the present study was to determine the genetic diversity and relationship within and between the four main Sudanese breeds of Nubian, Desert, Taggar and Nilotic goats. Using the 50 K SNP chip, 24 animals of each breed were genotyped. More than 96% of high quality SNPs were polymorphic with an average minor allele frequency of 0.3. In all breeds, no significant difference between observed (0.4) and expected (0.4) heterozygosity was found and the inbreeding coefficients (F-IS) did not differ from zero. F-st coefficients for the genetic distance between breeds also did not significantly deviate from zero. In addition, the analysis of molecular variance revealed that 93% of the total variance in the examined population can be explained by differences among individuals, while only 7% result from differences between the breeds. These findings provide evidence for high genetic diversity and little inbreeding within breeds on one hand, and low diversity between breeds on the other hand. Further examinations using Nei's genetic distance and STRUCTURE analysis clustered Taggar goats distinct from the other breeds. In a principal component (PC) analysis, PC1 could separate Taggar, Nilotic and a mix of Nubian and Desert goats into three groups. The SNPs that contributed strongly to PC1 showed high F-st values in Taggar goat versus the other goat breeds. PCA allowed us to identify target genomic regions which contain genes known to influence growth, development, bone formation and the immune system. The information on the genetic variability and diversity in this study confirmed that Taggar goat is genetically different from the other goat breeds in Sudan. The SNPs identified by the first principal components show high F-st values in Taggar goat and allowed to identify candidate genes which can be used in the development of breed selection programs to improve local breeds and find genetic factors contributing to the adaptation to harsh environments.",NA,NA,"OCT 23",2017,18,"",NA,"10.1186/s12863-017-0553-z",NA,"s12863-017-0553-z"

Therefore, it is necessary to obtain knowledge on genomic variation, population structure, and genetic diversity and to develop novel Insertion/Deletion (InDel) markers for quinoa by whole-genome re-sequencing. Results: We re-sequenced 11 quinoa accessions and obtained a coverage depth between approximately 7x to 23x the quinoa genome. Based on the 1453-megabase (Mb) assembly from the reference accession Riobamba, 8,441,022 filtered bi-allelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 842,783 filtered InDels were identified, with an estimated SNP and InDel density of 5.81 and 0.58 per kilobase (kb). From the genomic InDel variations, 85 dimorphic InDel markers were newly developed and validated. Together with the 62 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers reported, a total of 147 markers were used for genotyping the 129 quinoa accessions. Molecular grouping analysis showed classification into two major groups, the Andean highland (composed of the northern and southern highland subgroups) and Chilean coastal, based on combined STRUCTURE, phylogenetic tree and PCA (Principle Component Analysis) analyses. Further analysis of the genetic diversity exhibited a decreasing tendency from the Chilean coast group to the Andean highland group, and the gene flow between subgroups was more frequent than that between the two subgroups and the Chilean coastal group. The majority of the variations (approximately 70%) were found through an analysis of molecular variation (AMOVA) due to the diversity between the groups. This was congruent with the observation of a highly significant F-ST value (0.705) between the groups, demonstrating significant genetic differentiation between the Andean highland type of quinoa and the Chilean coastal type. Moreover, a core set of 16 quinoa germplasms that capture all 362 alleles was selected using a simulated annealing method. Conclusions: The large number of SNPs and InDels identified in this study demonstrated that the quinoa genome is enriched with genomic variations.

The study design consisted of 207 pigs that were housed and slaughtered under standardized conditions, and phenotyped for daily gain, feed intake, and feed conversion rate. The pigs were genotyped with a standard 60 K SNP chip. The GIT microbiota composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing technology. Eight from 49 investigated bacteria genera showed a significant narrow sense host heritability, ranging from 0.32 to 0.57. Microbial mixed linear models were applied to estimate the microbiota variance for each complex trait. The fraction of phenotypic variance explained by the microbial variance was 0.28, 0.21, and 0.16 for daily gain, feed conversion, and feed intake, respectively. The SNP data and the microbiota composition were used to predict the complex traits using genomic best linear unbiased prediction (G-BLUP) and microbial best linear unbiased prediction (M-BLUP) methods, respectively.

In this study, we use 41,304 informative SNPs genotyped in a Eucalyptus breeding population involving 90 E. grandis and 78 E. urophylla parents and their 949 F-1 hybrids to develop genomic prediction models for eight phenotypic traits-basic density and pulp yield, circumference at breast height and height and tree volume scored at age three and six years. We assessed the impact of different genomic prediction methods, the composition and size of the training and validation set and the number and genomic location of SNPs on the predictive ability (PA). Results: Heritabilities estimated using the realized genomic relationship matrix (GRM) were considerably higher than estimates based on the expected pedigree, mainly due to inconsistencies in the expected pedigree that were readily corrected by the GRM. Moreover, the GRM more precisely capture Mendelian sampling among related individuals, such that the genetic covariance was based on the true proportion of the genome shared between individuals. PA improved considerably when increasing the size of the training set and by enhancing relatedness to the validation set. Prediction models trained on pure species parents could not predict well in F-1 hybrids, indicating that model training has to be carried out in hybrid populations if one is to predict in hybrid selection candidates. The different genomic prediction methods provided similar results for all traits, therefore either GBLUP or rrBLUP represents better compromises between computational time and prediction efficiency. Only slight improvement was observed in PA when more than 5000 SNPs were used for all traits. Using SNPs in intergenic regions provided slightly better PA than using SNPs sampled exclusively in genic regions. Conclusions: The size and composition of the training set and number of SNPs used are the two most important factors for model prediction, compared to the statistical methods and the genomic location of SNPs. Furthermore, training the prediction model based on pure parental species only provide limited ability to predict traits in interspecific hybrids.

Results: Using the BayesB method, we identified 35 and 7 regions in Chinese Simmental cattle that displayed significant associations with individual fatty acids and fatty acid groups, respectively. We further obtained several candidate genes which may be involved in fatty acid biosynthesis including elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 5 (ELOVL5), fatty acid synthase (FASN), caspase 2 (CASP2) and thyroglobulin (TG). Specifically, we obtained strong evidence of association signals for one SNP located at 51.3 Mb for FASN using Genome-wide Rapid Association Mixed Model and Regression-Genomic Control (GRAMMAR-GC) approaches. Also, region-based association test identified multiple SNPs within FASN and ELOVL5 for C14:0. In addition, our result revealed that the effectiveness of genomic prediction for fatty acid composition using BayesB was slightly superior over GBLUP in Chinese Simmental cattle. Conclusions: We identified several significantly associated regions and loci which can be considered as potential candidate markers for genomics-assisted breeding programs.

Multivariate methods, such as structural equation modeling (SEM), are valuable in the phenotypic analysis of psychiatric and substance use phenotypes, but these methods have not been integrated into standard genome-wide association analyses because fitting a SEM at each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) along the genome was hitherto considered to be too computationally demanding. By developing a method that can efficiently fit SEMs, it is possible to expand the set of models that can be tested. This is particularly necessary in psychiatric and behavioral genetics, where the statistical methods are often handicapped by phenotypes with large components of stochastic variance. Due to the enormous amount of data that genome-wide scans produce, the statistical methods used to analyze the data are relatively elementary and do not directly correspond with the rich theoretical development, and lack the potential to test more complex hypotheses about the measurement of, and interaction between, comorbid traits. In this paper, we present a method to test the association of a SNP with multiple phenotypes or a latent construct on a genome-wide basis using a diagonally weighted least squares (DWLS) estimator for four common SEMs: a one-factor model, a one-factor residuals model, a two-factor model, and a latent growth model.

Under the Core-Periphery Hypothesis (CPH), genetic diversity is expected to be highest at the centre of a species' distribution, progressively decreasing with increased differentiation towards outer range limits, as populations become increasingly isolated, fragmented and locally adapted. The unique life history characteristics of many marine invertebrates such as high dispersal rates, stochastic survival and variable recruitment are also likely to influence how populations are organised. To examine the microevolutionary forces influencing population structure, connectivity and adaptive variation in a highly-dispersive bivalve, populations of the black-lip pearl oyster Pinctada margaritifera were examined across its similar to 18,000 km Indo-Pacific distribution. Results: Analyses utilising 9,624 genome-wide SNPs and 580 oysters, discovered differing patterns of significant and substantial broad-scale genetic structure between the Indian and Pacific Ocean basins. Indian Ocean populations were markedly divergent (F-st = 0.2534-0.4177, p < 0.001), compared to Pacific Ocean oysters, where basin-wide gene flow was much higher (F-st = 0.0007-0.1090, p < 0.001). Partitioning of genetic diversity (hierarchical AMOVA) attributed 18.1% of variance between ocean basins, whereas greater proportions were resolved within samples and populations (45.8% and 35.7% respectively). Visualisation of population structure at selectively neutral loci resolved three and five discrete genetic clusters for the Indian and Pacific Oceans respectively. Evaluation of genetic structure at adaptive loci for Pacific populations (89 SNPs under directional selection; Fst = 0.1012-0.4371, FDR = 0.05), revealed five clusters identical to those detected at neutral SNPs, suggesting environmental heterogeneity within the Pacific. Patterns of structure and connectivity were supported by Mantel tests of isolation by distance (IBD) and independent hydrodynamic particle dispersal simulations. Conclusions: It is evident that genetic structure and connectivity across the natural range of P. margaritifera is highly complex, and produced by the interaction of ocean currents, IBD and seascape features at a broad scale, together with habitat geomorphology and local adaptation at regional levels. Overall population organisation is far more elaborate than generalised CPH predictions, however valuable insights for regional fishery management, and a greater understanding of range-wide genetic structure in a highly-dispersive marine invertebrate have been gained.",NA,NA,"JAN 10",2017,18,"",NA,"10.1186/s12864-016-3410-y",NA,"s12864-016-3410-y"

However, little research has been done to identify such interactions on a genome-wide scale. The aim of this studies was to identify genes with genetic-epigenetic interactions associated with asthma. Methods: Using asthma case-control data, we applied a novel nonparametric gene-centric approach to test for interactions between multiple SNPs and CpG sites simultaneously in the vicinities of 18,178 genes across the genome. Results: Twelve genes, PF4, ATF3, TPRA1, HOPX, SCARNA18, STC1, OR10K1, UPK1B, LOC101928523, LHX6, CHMP4B, and LANCL1, exhibited statistically significant SNP-CpG interactions (false discovery rate = 0.05). Of these, three have previously been implicated in asthma risk (PF4, ATF3, and TPRA1). Follow-up analysis revealed statistically significant pairwise SNP-CpG interactions for several of these genes, including SCARNA18, LHX6, and LOC101928523 (p = 1.33E-04, 8.21E-04, 1.11E-03, respectively). Conclusions: Joint effects of genetic and epigenetic variation may play an important role in asthma pathogenesis.

To explore the genetic basis of high-altitude adaptation in poikilothermic animals, we acquired transcriptome sequences from a high-altitude population and a low-altitude population of the Asiatic toad (Bufo gargarizans). Transcriptome data from another high-altitude amphibian, Rana kukunoris and its low-altitude relative R. chensiensis, which are from a previous study, were also incorporated into our comparative analysis. Results: More than 40,000 transcripts were obtained from each transcriptome, and 5107 one-to-one orthologs were identified among the four taxa for comparative analysis. A total of 29 (Bufo) and 33 (Rana) putative positively selected genes were identified for the two high-altitude species, which were mainly concentrated in nutrient metabolism related functions. Using SNP-tagging and F-ST outlier analysis, we further tested 89 other nutrient metabolism related genes for signatures of natural selection, and found that two genes, CAPN2 and ITPR1, were likely under balancing selection. We did not detect any positively selected genes associated with response to hypoxia. Conclusions: Amphibians clearly employ different genetic mechanisms for high-altitude adaptation compared to endotherms.

Genotyping by sequencing (GBS), a reduced representation library sequencing method, allows highly multiplexed sequencing of genomic subsets. This method has limitations for small organisms with low amounts of genomic DNA, such as the bluetongue virus (BTV) vectors, Culicoides midges. Results: This study employed the GBS method to isolate SNP markers de novo from whole genome amplified Culicoides brevitarsis genomic DNA. The individuals were collected from regions representing two different Australian patterns of BTV strain distribution: the Northern Territory (NT) and the east coast. We isolated 8145 SNPs using GBS. Phylogenetic analysis conducted using the filtered 3263 SNPs revealed the presence of a distinct C. brevitarsis sub-population in the NT and this was confirmed by analysis of mitochondrial DNA. Two loci showed a very strong signal for selection and were unique to the NT population. Bayesian analysis with STRUCTURE indicated a possible two-population cluster. Conclusions: The results suggest that genotyping vectors with high density markers in combination with biological and environmental data is useful. However, more extensive sampling over a wider spatial and temporal range is needed. The presence of sub-structure in populations and loci under natural selection indicates the need for further investigation of the role of vectors in shaping the two Australian systems of BTV transmission.

However, whole genome resequencing in loblolly pine is hampered by its large size and complexity and a lack of a good reference. As a valid and more feasible alternative, entire exome sequencing was hence employed to identify the gene-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and to genotype the sampled trees. Results: The exons were captured in the ADEPT2 association mapping population of 375 clonally-propagated loblolly pine trees using NimbleGen oligonucleotide hybridization probes, and then exome-enriched genomic DNA fragments were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Oligonucleotide probes were designed based on 199,723 exons (approximate to 49 Mbp) partitioned from the loblolly pine reference genome (PineRefSeq v. 1.01). The probes covered 90.2 % of the target regions. Capture efficiency was high; on average, 67 % of the sequence reads generated for each tree could be mapped to the capture target regions, and more than 70 % of the captured target bases had at least 10X sequencing depth per tree. A total of 972,720 high quality SNPs were identified after filtering. Among them, 53 % were located in coding regions (CDS), 5 % in 5' or 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) and 42 % in non-target and non-coding regions, such as introns and adjacent intergenic regions collaterally captured. We found that linkage disequilibrium (LD) decayed very rapidly, with the correlation coefficient (r(2)) between pairs of SNPs linked within single scaffolds decaying to half maximum (r(2) = 0.22) within 55 bp, to r(2) = 0.1 within 192 bp, and to r(2) = 0.05 within 451 bp. Population structure analysis using unlinked SNPs demonstrated the presence of two main distinct clusters representing western and eastern parts of the loblolly pine range included in our sample of trees.

The central component of all these protocols is the digestion of the initial DNA with known restriction enzymes, to generate sequencing fragments at predictable and reproducible sites. This allows to genotype thousands of genetic markers on populations with hundreds of individuals. Because GBS protocols achieve parallel genotyping through high throughput sequencing (HTS), every GBS protocol must include a bioinformatics pipeline for analysis of HTS data. Our bioinformatics group recently developed the Next Generation Sequencing Eclipse Plugin (NGSEP) for accurate, efficient, and user-friendly analysis of HTS data. Results: Here we present the latest functionalities implemented in NGSEP in the context of the analysis of GBS data. We implemented a one step wizard to perform parallel read alignment, variants identification and genotyping from HTS reads sequenced from entire populations. We added different filters for variants, samples and genotype calls as well as calculation of summary statistics overall and per sample, and diversity statistics per site. NGSEP includes a module to translate genotype calls to some of the most widely used input formats for integration with several tools to perform downstream analyses such as population structure analysis, construction of genetic maps, genetic mapping of complex traits and phenotype prediction for genomic selection. We assessed the accuracy of NGSEP on two highly heterozygous F1 cassava populations and on an inbred common bean population, and we showed that NGSEP provides similar or better accuracy compared to other widely used software packages for variants detection such as GATK, Samtools and Tassel.

To prevent confounding results from a GWAS to investigate drug response, it is necessary to account for concomitant medications, defined as any medication taken concurrently with the primary medication being investigated. We use data from the Action to Control Cardiovascular Disease (ACCORD) trial in order to implement a novel scoring procedure for incorporating concomitant medication information into a linear regression model in preparation for GWAS. In order to accomplish this, two primary medications were selected: thiazolidinediones and metformin because of the wide-spread use of these medications and large sample sizes available within the ACCORD trial. A third medication, fenofibrate, along with a known confounding medication, statin, were chosen as a proof-of-principle for the scoring procedure. Previous studies have identified SNP rs7412 as being associated with statin response. Here we hypothesize that including the score for statin as a covariate in the GWAS model will correct for confounding of statin and yield a change in association at rs7412. The response of the confounded signal was successfully diminished from p = 3.19 x 10(-7) to p = 1.76 x 10(-5), by accounting for statin using the scoring procedure presented here.

Between breed variation amongst Iranian cattle explained 60 % (p < 0.001) of the total molecular variation and 82.88 % (p < 0.001) when outgroups were included. Several migration edges were observed within the Iranian cattle breeds. The highest indicine proportion was found in Sistani. All Iranian breeds with higher indicine ancestry were more admixed with a complex migration pattern. Nineteen founder populations most accurately explained the admixture of 44 selected representative cattle breeds (standard error 0.4617). Low levels of African ancestry were identified in Iranian cattle breeds (on average 7.5 %); however, the signal did not persist through all analyses. Admixture and migration analyses revealed minimal introgression from Iranian cattle into other taurine cattle (Holstein, Hanwoo, Anatolian breeds). Conclusion: The eight Iranian cattle breeds feature a discrete genetic composition which should be considered in conservation programs aimed at preserving unique species and genetic diversity. Despite a complex admixture pattern among Iranian cattle breeds, there was no strong introgression from other world-wide cattle breeds into Iranian cattle and vice versa.

We used these markers to estimate genomic patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in Gff, and used the information, in combination with outlier-locus detection tests, to identify candidate regions of the genome under selection. LD in individual populations decays to half of its maximum value (r(max)(2)/2) between 1359 and 2429 bp. The overall LD estimated for the species reaches r(max)(2)/2 at 708 bp, an order of magnitude slower than in Drosophila. Using 53 infected (Trypanosoma spp.) and uninfected flies from four genetically distinct Ugandan populations adapted to different environmental conditions, we were able to identify SNPs associated with the infection status of the fly and local environmental adaptation. The extent of LD in Gff likely facilitated the detection of loci under selection, despite the small sample size. Furthermore, it is probable that LD in the regions identified is much higher than the average genomic LD due to strong selection.

Whitebark is susceptible to multiple threats - climate change, white pine blister rust, mountain pine beetle, and fire exclusion - and it is suffering significant mortality range-wide, prompting the tree to be listed as `globally endangered' by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and `endangered' by the Canadian government. Conservation collections (in situ and ex situ) are being initiated to preserve the genetic legacy of the species. Reliable, transferrable, and highly variable genetic markers are essential for quantifying the genetic profiles of seed collections relative to natural stands, and ensuring the completeness of conservation collections. We evaluated the use of hybridization-based target capture to enrich specific genomic regions from the 27 GB genome of whitebark pine, and to evaluate genetic variation across loci, trees, and geography. Probes were designed to capture 7,849 distinct genes, and screening was performed on 48 trees. Despite the inclusion of repetitive elements in the probe pool, the resulting dataset provided information on 4,452 genes and 32% of targeted positions (528,873 bp), and we were able to identify 12,390 segregating sites from 47 trees. Variations reveal strong geographic trends in heterozygosity and allelic richness, with trees from the southern Cascade and Sierra Range showing the greatest distinctiveness and differentiation. Our results show that even under non-optimal conditions (low enrichment efficiency; inclusion of repetitive elements in baits), targeted enrichment produces high quality, codominant genotypes from large genomes. The resulting data can be readily integrated into management and gene conservation activities for whitebark pine, and have the potential to be applied to other members of 5-needle pine group (Pious subsect.

In the present study, two chicken populations were used to investigate the genetic architecture of avian resistance to colonisation: (i) a back-cross of two White Leghorn derived inbred lines [(6(1) x N) x N] known to differ in resistance to Campylobacter colonisation and (ii) a 9th generation advanced intercross (6(1) x N) line. Results: The level of colonisation with Campylobacter jejuni following experimental infection was found to be a quantitative trait. A back-cross experiment using 1,243 fully informative single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers revealed quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosomes 7, 11 and 14. In the advanced intercross line study, the location of the QTL on chromosome 14 was confirmed and refined and two new QTLs were identified located on chromosomes 4 and 16. Pathway and re-sequencing data analysis of the genes located in the QTL candidate regions identified potential pathways, networks and candidate resistance genes. Finally, gene expression analyses were performed for some of the candidate resistance genes to support the results. Conclusion: Campylobacter resistance in chickens is a complex trait, possibly involving the Major Histocompatibility Complex, innate and adaptive immune responses, cadherins and other factors. Two of the QTLs for Campylobacter resistance are co-located with Salmonella resistance loci, indicating that it may be possible to breed simultaneously for enhanced resistance to both zoonoses.",NA,NA,"APR 18",2016,17,"",NA,"10.1186/s12864-016-2612-7",NA,"s12864-016-2612-7"

These declines could reduce genetic variation and thus hamper the species' ability to adapt. Active restoration strategies are a common conservation approach to mitigate species' declines and require genetic data on surviving populations to efficiently respond to declines while maintaining the genetic diversity needed to adapt to changing conditions. To evaluate active restoration strategies for the staghorn coral, the genetic diversity of A. cervicornis within and among populations was assessed in 77 individuals collected from 68 locations along the Florida Reef Tract (FRT) and in the Dominican Republic. Results: Genotyping by Sequencing (GBS) identified 4,764 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Pairwise nucleotide differences (p) within a population are large (similar to 37 %) and similar to p across all individuals. This high level of genetic diversity along the FRT is similar to the diversity within a small, isolated reef. Much of the genetic diversity (> 90 %) exists within a population, yet GBS analysis shows significant variation along the FRT, including 300 SNPs with significant F-ST values and significant divergence relative to distance. There are also significant differences in SNP allele frequencies over small spatial scales, exemplified by the large F-ST values among corals collected within Miami-Dade county. Conclusions: Large standing diversity was found within each population even after recent declines in abundance, including significant, potentially adaptive divergence over short distances. The data here inform conservation and management actions by uncovering population structure and high levels of diversity maintained within coral collections among sites previously shown to have little genetic divergence. More broadly, this approach demonstrates the power of GBS to resolve differences among individuals and identify subtle genetic structure, informing conservation goals with evolutionary implications.",NA,NA,"APR 13",2016,17,"",NA,"10.1186/s12864-016-2583-8",NA,"s12864-016-2583-8"

In vitro APO-BEC3F (A3F) anti-HIV-1 activity is weaker than A3G but is partially resistant to Vif degradation unlike A3G. It is unknown whether A3F protein affects HIV-1 disease in vivo. To assess the effect of A3F gene on host susceptibility to HIV-acquisition and disease progression, we performed a genetic association study in six well-characterized HIV-1 natural cohorts. A common six-Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) haplotype of A3F tagged by a codon-changing variant (p.

A validation study in the International Collaboration for the Genomics of HIV (ICGH) showed a consistent association with lower set-point viral load.

Variant calling error rates, however, are higher in GBS than in standard sequencing, in particular due to restriction site polymorphisms, and few computational tools exist that specifically model and correct these errors. We developed a statistical method to remove errors caused by restriction site polymorphisms, implemented in the software package GBStools. We evaluated it in several simulated data sets, varying in number of samples, mean coverage and population mutation rate, and in two empirical human data sets (N = 8 and N = 63 samples). In our simulations, GBStools improved genotype accuracy more than commonly used filters such as Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p-values. GBStools is most effective at removing genotype errors in data sets over 100 samples when coverage is 40X or higher, and the improvement is most pronounced in species with high genomic diversity.

The proportion of phenotypic variance explained by significant associations is, however, limited. Given the same dense SNP panels, mixed model analyses capture a greater proportion of phenotypic variance than single SNP analyses but the total is generally still less than the genetic variance estimated from pedigree studies. Combining information frompedigree relationships and SNPs, we examined 16 complex anthropometric and cardiometabolic traits in a Scottish family-based cohort comprising up to 20,000 individuals genotyped for similar to 520,000 common autosomal SNPs. The inclusion of related individuals provides the opportunity to also estimate the genetic variance associated with pedigree as well as the effects of common family environment. Trait variation was partitioned into SNP-associated and pedigree-associated genetic variation, shared nuclear family environment, shared couple (partner) environment and shared full-sibling environment. Results demonstrate that trait heritabilities vary widely but, on average across traits, SNP-associated and pedigree-associated genetic effects each explain around half the genetic variance. For most traits the recently-shared environment of couples is also significant, accounting for similar to 11% of the phenotypic variance on average. On the other hand, the environment shared largely in the past by members of a nuclear family or by full-siblings, has a more limited impact. Our findings point to appropriate models to use in future studies as pedigree-associated genetic effects and couple environmental effects have seldom been taken into account in genotype-based analyses.

The three studied sites were found to differ significantly in the distribution of taxa with a higher prevalence of M. trossulus in the inner fjord. The identified M. edulis x M. trossulus hybrids mostly had a hybrid index score of about 0.5, indicating a similar number of alleles characteristic for M. trossulus and M. edulis. There was a low number of backcrosses between 'pure' taxa and hybrids. This newly discovered hybrid zone between the two taxa is unique in comparison with the Canadian populations.

We investigated whether the DNA methylation levels at the top 10CpG sites previously associated with exposure to maternal smoking during gestation were associated with individual genetic variation at the genome-wide level. Genome-wide association tests between DNA methylation at the top 10 candidate CpG and genome-wide SNPs were performed in 736 case and control participants of the California Childhood Leukemia Study.

Genomic prediction and estimation using haplotypes in genome regions with functional elements such as all genes of the genome can be an approach to integrate functional and structural genomic information for genomic selection. Towards this goal, this article develops a new haplotype approach for genomic prediction and estimation. Results: A multi-allelic haplotype model treating each haplotype as an 'allele' was developed for genomic prediction and estimation based on the partition of a multi-allelic genotypic value into additive and dominance values. Each additive value is expressed as a function of h-1 additive effects, where h = number of alleles or haplotypes, and each dominance value is expressed as a function of h(h - 1)/2 dominance effects. For a sample of q individuals, the limit number of effects is 2q - 1 for additive effects and is the number of heterozygous genotypes for dominance effects. Additive values are factorized as a product between the additive model matrix and the h - 1 additive effects, and dominance values are factorized as a product between the dominance model matrix and the h(h - 1)/2 dominance effects. Genomic additive relationship matrix is defined as a function of the haplotype model matrix for additive effects, and genomic dominance relationship matrix is defined as a function of the haplotype model matrix for dominance effects. Based on these results, a mixed model implementation for genomic prediction and variance component estimation that jointly use haplotypes and single markers is established, including two computing strategies for genomic prediction and variance component estimation with identical results.

The tumor is one of only two naturally occurring transmissible cancers and is almost inevitably fatal. In 2006 a disease-free insurance population was established to ensure that the Tasmanian devil is protected from extinction. The insurance program is dependent upon preserving as much wild genetic diversity as possible to maximize the success of subsequent reintroductions to the wild. Accurate genotypic data is vital to the success of the program to ensure that loss of genetic diversity does not occur in captivity. Until recently, microsatellite markers have been used to study devil population genetics, however as genetic diversity is low in the devil and potentially decreasing in the captive population, a more sensitive genotyping assay is required. Methods: Utilising the devil reference genome and whole genome re-sequencing data, we have identified polymorphic regions for use in a custom genotyping assay. These regions were amplified using PCR and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform to refine a set a markers to genotype the Tasmanian devil insurance population. Results: We have developed a set of single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) markers, assayed by amplicon sequencing, that provide a high-throughput method for monitoring genetic diversity and assessing familial relationships among devils. To date we have used a total of 267 unique SNPs within both putatively neutral and functional loci to genotype 305 individuals in the Tasmanian devil insurance population. We have used these data to assess genetic diversity in the population as well as resolve the parentage of 21 offspring.

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) provides the opportunity to determine LD structures at maximal resolution. Results: We compare LD maps constructed from WGS data with LD maps produced from the array-based HapMap dataset, for representative European and African populations. WGS provides up to 5.7-fold greater SNP density than array-based data and achieves much greater resolution of LD structure, allowing for identification of up to 2.8-fold more regions of intense recombination. The absence of ascertainment bias in variant genotyping improves the population representativeness of the WGS maps, and highlights the extent of uncaptured variation using array genotyping methodologies. The complete capture of LD patterns using WGS allows for higher genome-wide association study (GWAS) power compared to array-based GWAS, with WGS also allowing for the analysis of rare variation. The impact of marker ascertainment issues in arrays has been greatest for Sub-Saharan African populations where larger sample sizes and substantially higher marker densities are required to fully resolve the LD structure. Conclusions: WGS provides the best possible resource for LD mapping due to the maximal marker density and lack of ascertainment bias. WGS LD maps provide a rich resource for medical and population genetics studies. The increasing availability of WGS data for large populations will allow for improved research utilising LD, such as GWAS and recombination biology studies.",NA,NA,"SEP 3",2015,16,"",NA,"10.1186/s12864-015-1854-0",NA,"s12864-015-1854-0"

The European eel presents a complex life cycle with two metamorphoses, a first metamorphosis from larvae into glass eels (juvenile stage) and a second metamorphosis into silver eels (adult stage). We tested the hypothesis that different genes and gene pathways will be under selection at different life stages when comparing the genetic associations between glass eels and silver eels. Results: We used two sets of markers to test for selection: first, we genotyped individuals using a panel of 80 coding-gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) developed in American eel; second, we investigated selection at the genome level using a total of 153,423 RAD-sequencing generated SNPs widely distributed across the genome. Using the RAD approach, outlier tests identified a total of 2413 (1.57 %) potentially selected SNPs. Functional annotation analysis identified signal transduction pathways as the most over-represented group of genes, including MAPK/Erk signalling, calcium signalling and GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) signalling. Many of the over-represented pathways were related to growth, while others could result from the different conditions that eels inhabit during their life cycle. Conclusions: The observation of different genes and gene pathways under selection when comparing glass eels vs. silver eels supports the adaptive decoupling hypothesis for the benefits of metamorphosis. Partitioning the life cycle into discrete morphological phases may be overall beneficial since it allows the different life stages to respond independently to their unique selection pressures. This might translate into a more effective use of food and niche resources and/or performance of phase-specific tasks (e.g. feeding in the case of glass eels, migrating and reproducing in the case of silver eels).",NA,NA,"AUG 13",2015,16,"",NA,"10.1186/s12864-015-1754-3",NA,"s12864-015-1754-3"

Its etiology is multifactorial with genes and environmental factors, including chronic maternal stress, contributing to its risk. Our objective was to investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in the stress response are associated with spontaneous preterm birth using a candidate gene approach. Methods: A total of 210 cases (singleton spontaneous preterm birth at < 37 weeks) and 412 controls (singleton term birth at 38-42 weeks without a history of preterm birth) were studied. High quality maternal DNA was available from saliva samples of 190 cases and 369 controls and compared. Sociodemographic and medical data were collected. Sixteen SNPs, either tag SNPs located in key genes involved in the stress response identified in the Preterm Birth Genome Project database or SNPs found to be associated with adverse mental health outcomes in the published literature, were selected for genotyping and sequencing. SNPs were genotyped using Taqman (R) SNP genotyping assays. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed. Results: Multivariate analysis showed that two SNPs located in the mineralocorticoid receptor gene were significantly associated with spontaneous preterm birth: rs17484063 (OR 0.50, p = 0.038) and rs2883929 (OR 0.49, p = 0.017), regardless of maternal age, smoking, alcohol use, educational status, and history of spontaneous miscarriage. Conclusion: This report demonstrates an association between mineralocorticoid receptor gene polymorphisms, rs17484063 and rs2883929, and preterm birth, supporting a role for genetics in the association between chronic maternal stress and preterm birth.

While most studies on imprinting address its underlying molecular mechanisms or attempt at discovering genomic regions that might be subject to imprinting, few have focused on the amount of phenotypic variation contributed by such epigenetic process. In this report, we give a brief review of a one-locus imprinting model in a quantitative genetics framework, and provide a decomposition of the genetic variance according to this model. Analytical deductions from the proposed imprinting model indicated a non-negligible contribution of imprinting to genetic variation of complex traits. Also, we performed a whole-genome scan analysis on mouse body mass index (BMI) aiming at revealing potential consequences when existing imprinting effects are ignored in genetic analysis. Results: 10,021 SNP markers were used to perform a whole-genome single marker regression on mouse BMI using an additive and an imprinting model. Markers significant for imprinting indicated that BMI is subject to imprinting. Marked variance changed from 1.218x10(-4) to 1.842x10(-4) when imprinting was considered in the analysis, implying that one third of marked variance would be lost if existing imprinting effects were not accounted for. When both marker and pedigree information were used, estimated heritability increased from 0.176 to 0.195 when imprinting was considered. Conclusions: When a complex trait is subject to imprinting, using an additive model that ignores this phenomenon may result in an underestimate of additive variability, potentially leading to wrong inferences about the underlying genetic architecture of that trait. This could be a possible factor explaining part of the missing heritability commonly observed in genome-wide association studies (GWAS).",NA,NA,"AUG 5",2015,16,"",NA,"10.1186/s12864-015-1721-z",NA,"s12864-015-1721-z"

Recent GWAS identified several variants associated with AF, but they account for <10% of heritability. Gene-gene interaction is assumed to account for a significant portion of missing heritability. Among GWAS loci for AF, only three were replicated in the Chinese Han population, including SNP rs2106261 (G/A substitution) in ZFHX3, rs2200733 (C/T substitution) near PITX2c, and rs3807989 (A/G substitution) in CAV1. Thus, we analyzed the interaction among these three AF loci. We demonstrated significant interaction between rs2106261 and rs2200733 in three independent populations and combined population with 2,020 cases/5,315 controls. Compared to non-risk genotype GGCC, two-locus risk genotype AATT showed the highest odds ratio in three independent populations and the combined population (OR= 5.36 (95% CI 3.87-7.43), P= 8.00x10(-24)). The OR of 5.36 for AATT was significantly higher than the combined OR of 3.31 for both GGTT and AACC, suggesting a synergistic interaction between rs2106261 and rs2200733. Relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) analysis also revealed significant interaction between rs2106261 and rs2200733 when exposed two copies of risk alleles (RERI=2.87, P<1.00x10(-4)) or exposed to one additional copy of risk allele (RERI=1.29, P<1.00x10(-4)).

Mechanistically, PITX2c negatively regulates expression of miR-1, which negatively regulates expression of ZFHX3, resulting in a positive regulation of ZFHX3 by PITX2c; ZFHX3 positively regulates expression of PITX2C, resulting in a cyclic loop of cross-regulation between ZFHX3 and PITX2c. Both ZFHX3 and PITX2c regulate expression of NPPA, TBX5 and NKX2.5.

The seizure characteristics, including focal and generalised seizures, are similar between the two species, with gene discovery facilitated by the reduced genetic heterogeneity of purebred dogs. We have recently identified a risk locus for idiopathic epilepsy in the Belgian Shepherd breed on a 4.4 megabase region on CFA37. Results: We have expanded a previous study replicating the association with a combined analysis of 157 cases and 179 controls in three additional breeds: Schipperke, Finnish Spitz and Beagle (p(c) = 2.9e-07, p(GWAS) = 1.74E-02). A targeted resequencing of the 4.4 megabase region in twelve Belgian Shepherd cases and twelve controls with opposite haplotypes identified 37 case-specific variants within the ADAM23 gene. Twenty-seven variants were validated in 285 cases and 355 controls from four breeds, resulting in a strong replication of the ADAM23 locus (p(raw) = 2.76e-15) and the identification of a common 28 kb-risk haplotype in all four breeds. Risk haplotype was present in frequencies of 0.49-0.7 in the breeds, suggesting that ADAM23 is a low penetrance risk gene for canine epilepsy. Conclusions: These results implicate ADAM23 in common canine idiopathic epilepsy, although the causative variant remains yet to be identified.

HNA-2 deficient individuals are prone to produce HNA-2 alloantibodies that cause a number of disorders including transfusion-related acute lung injury and immune neutropenia.

The underlying genetic mechanism of HNA-2 deficiency and expression variations has remained a mystery. In this study, we identified a novel CD177 nonsense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP 829A>T) that creates a stop codon within the CD177 coding region. We found that all 829TT homozygous individuals were HNA-2 deficient. In addition, the SNP 829A>T genotypes were significantly associated with the percentage of HNA-2 positive neutrophils. Transfection experiments confirmed that HNA-2 expression was absent on cells expressing the CD177 SNP 829T allele.

Although genetic analyses have been performed through conventional selection and breeding efforts, the domestication history of NHCC and the genetics underlying its morphological diversity remain unclear. Thus, the reliable molecular markers representative of the whole genome are required for molecular-assisted selection in NHCC. Results: A total of 20,836 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were detected in NHCC, containing repeat types from mononucleotide to nonanucleotide. The average density was 62.93 SSRs/Mb. In gene regions, 5,435 SSRs were identified in 4,569 genes. A total of 5,008 primer pairs were designed, and 74 were randomly selected for validation. Among these, 60 (81.08%) were polymorphic in 18 Cruciferae. The number of polymorphic bands ranged from two to five, with an average of 2.70 for each primer. The average values of the polymorphism information content, observed heterozygosity, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and Shannon's information index were 0.2970, 0.4136, 0.5706, and 0.5885, respectively. Four clusters were classified according to the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic average cluster analysis of 18 genotypes. In addition, a total of 1,228,979 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in the NHCC through a comparison with the genome of Chinese cabbage, and the average SNP density in the whole genome was 4.33/Kb. The number of SNPs ranged from 341,939 to 591,586 in the 10 accessions, and the average heterozygous SNPs ratio was similar to 42.53%. All analyses showed these markers were high quality and reliable. Therefore, they could be used in the construction of a linkage map and for genetic diversity studies for NHCC in future. Conclusions: This is the first systematic and comprehensive analysis and identification of SSRs in NHCC and 17 species.

Asperger Syndrome (AS) is one subgroup of ASC and differs from classic autism in that in AS there is no language or general cognitive delay. Genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors are implicated in ASC and genes involved in neural connectivity and neurodevelopment are good candidates for studying the susceptibility to ASC. The aryl-hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator 2 (ARNT2) gene encodes a transcription factor involved in neurodevelopmental processes, neuronal connectivity and cellular responses to hypoxia.

P values were adjusted for multiple comparisons, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) among the SNPs analysed was calculated in our sample. Finally, SNP annotation allowed functional and structural analyses of the genetic variants in ARNT2.

In addition, GWAS and population-genetic data now frequently contain genotype likelihoods, phase information, and/or multiallelic variants, none of which can be represented by PLINK 1's primary data format. Findings: To address these issues, we are developing a second-generation codebase for PLINK. The first major release from this codebase, PLINK 1.9, introduces extensive use of bit-level parallelism, O(root n)-time/constant-space Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and Fisher's exact tests, and many other algorithmic improvements. In combination, these changes accelerate most operations by 1-4 orders of magnitude, and allow the program to handle datasets too large to fit in RAM. We have also developed an extension to the data format which adds low-overhead support for genotype likelihoods, phase, multiallelic variants, and reference vs. alternate alleles, which is the basis of our planned second release ( PLINK 2.0).

However, similarities in the genetic architecture and molecular regulations underlying phenotypic variations in humans and swine have not been systematically assessed. Results: We systematically surveyed similar to 500 F2 pigs genetically and phenotypically. By comparing candidates for anemia traits identified in swine genome-wide SNP association and human genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we showed that both sets of candidates are related to the biological process cellular lipid metabolism in liver. Human height is a complex heritable trait; by integrating genome-wide SNP data and human adipose Bayesian causal network, which closely represents bone transcriptional regulations, we identified PLAG1 as a causal gene for limb bone length. This finding is consistent with GWAS findings for human height and supports the common genetic architecture between swine and humans. By leveraging a human protein- protein interaction network, we identified two putative candidate causal genes TGFB3 and DAB2IP and the known regulators MESP1 and MESP2 as responsible for the variation in rib number and identified the potential underlying molecular mechanisms. In mice, knockout of Tgfb3 and Tgfb2 together decreases rib number. Conclusion: Our findings show that integrative network analyses reveal causal regulators underlying the genetic association of complex traits in swine and that these causal regulators have similar effects in humans.

In this study, 42 microsatellite loci and 384 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used to characterize the first association mapping population used for quantitative trait loci mapping in sunflower, along with a selection of allied open-pollinated and composite populations from the germplasm bank of the National Institute of Agricultural Technology of Argentina. The ability of different kinds of markers to assess genetic diversity and population structure was also evaluated. Results: The analysis of polymorphism in the set of sunflower accessions studied here showed that both the microsatellites and SNP markers were informative for germplasm characterization, although to different extents. In general, the estimates of genetic variability were moderate. The average genetic diversity, as quantified by the expected heterozygosity, was 0.52 for SSR loci and 0.29 for SNPs. Within SSR markers, those derived from non-coding regions were able to capture higher levels of diversity than EST-SSR. A significant correlation was found between SSR and SNP-based genetic distances among accessions. Bayesian and multivariate methods were used to infer population structure. Evidence for the existence of three different genetic groups was found consistently across data sets (i.e., SSR, SNP and SSR + SNP), with the maintainer/restorer status being the most prevalent characteristic associated with group delimitation. Conclusion: The present study constitutes the first report comparing the performance of SSR and SNP markers for population genetics analysis in cultivated sunflower.

We define a microhaplotype to be a locus with two or more single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that occur within a short segment of DNA (e. g., 200 bp) that can be covered by a single sequence run and collectively define a multiallelic locus. Microhaplotypes can be highly informative for many forensic questions, including detection of mixtures of two or more sources in a DNA sample, a common problem in forensic practice. Results: When all alleles are equally frequent, the probability of detecting three or more alleles in a mixture is at maximum. The classical population genetics concept of effective number of alleles at a locus, termed A(e), converts the unequal allele frequencies at a locus into a value that is equivalent to some number of equally frequent alleles, allowing microhaplotype loci to be ranked. The expectations for the ability to qualitatively detect mixtures are given for different integer values of Ae, and the cumulative probabilities of detecting mixtures based on testing multiple microhaps are shown to exceed 95% with as few as five loci with average Ae values of even slightly greater than 3.0. Conclusions: Microhaplotypes with Ae values of > 3 will be exceedingly useful in ordinary forensic practice.

The aim of the present study was to investigate a possible hereditary disposition to PNSTs in dairy cattle by statistical analysis performed on data from 567 cattle with PNSTs. Furthermore, a preliminary genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed on DNA isolated from 28 affected and 28 non-affected Holstein cows to identify loci in the bovine genome involved in the development of PNSTs. Results: PNSTs were significantly more common in the Danish Holstein breed than in other breeds with 0.49% of Danish Holsteins slaughtered during an eight-year-period having PNSTs. PNSTs also occurred significantly more frequently in the offspring of some specific Holstein sires. Examination of three generation pedigrees showed that these sires were genetically related through a widely used US Holstein sire. The PNSTs included in GWAS were histologically classified as neurofibroma-schwannoma (43%), schwannoma (36%) and neurofibroma (21%) and derived from Holstein cows with multiple PNSTs. A single SNP on chromosome 27 reached genome-wide significance. Conclusions: Gross and histological characteristics of bovine PNSTs are comparable to PNSTs in humans (schwannomatosis).

As with other aquaculture species, rainbow trout and steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) are susceptible to disease and outbreaks can lead to significant losses. Fish culturists have therefore been pursuing strategies to prevent losses to common pathogens such as Flavobacterium psychrophilum (the etiological agent for bacterial cold water disease [CWD]) and infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) by adjusting feed formulations, vaccine development, and selective breeding. However, discovery of genetic markers linked to disease resistance offers the potential to use marker-assisted selection to increase resistance and reduce outbreaks. For this study we sampled juvenile fish from 40 families from 2-yr classes that either survived or died after controlled exposure to either CWD or IHNV. Restriction site-associated DNA sequencing produced 4661 polymorphic single-nucleotide polymorphism loci after strict filtering. Genotypes from individual survivors and mortalities were then used to test for association between disease resistance and genotype at each locus using the program TASSEL. After we accounted for kinship and stratification of the samples, tests revealed 12 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers that were highly associated with resistance to CWD and 19 markers associated with resistance to IHNV.

Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) is a one such method highly suited to non-human organisms. In the GBS protocol, genomic DNA is fractionated via restriction digest, then reduced representation is achieved through size selection. Since many restriction sites are conserved across a species, the sequenced portion of the genome is highly consistent within a population. This makes the GBS protocol highly suited for experiments that require surveying large numbers of markers within a population, such as those involving genetic mapping, breeding, and population genomics. We have modified the GBS technology in a number of ways. Custom, enzyme specific adaptors have been replaced with standard Illumina adaptors compatible with blunt-end restriction enzymes. Multiplexing is achieved through a dual barcoding system, and bead-based library preparation protocols allows for in-solution size selection and eliminates the need for columns and gels. Results: A panel of eight restriction enzymes was selected for testing on B73 maize and Nipponbare rice genomic DNA. Quality of the data was demonstrated by identifying that the vast majority of reads from each enzyme aligned to restriction sites predicted in silico. The link between enzyme parameters and experimental outcome was demonstrated by showing that the sequenced portion of the genome was adaptable by selecting enzymes based on motif length, complexity, and methylation sensitivity. The utility of the new GBS protocol was demonstrated by correctly mapping several in a maize F-2 population resulting from a B73 x Country Gentleman test cross.

The accumulated recombination events in an advanced intercross line (AIL), in which mice from two inbred strains are mated at random for several generations, can improve mapping resolution. We demonstrate these advancements in mapping QTLs for hindlimb muscle weights in an AIL (n = 832) of the C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) strains, generations F8-F13. We mapped muscle weight QTLs using the high-density MegaMUGA SNP panel.

Out of the 15 muscle weight QTLs identified in the AIL, nine overlapped the genomic regions discovered in an earlier B6D2 F2 intercross. Mapping resolution, however, was substantially improved in our study to a median QTL interval of 12.5 Mb. Subsequent sequence analysis of the QTL regions revealed 20 genes with nonsense or potentially damaging missense mutations.

However, research and understanding of the impact of initial SNP-data quality control on imputation results is still limited. In this paper, we aim to evaluate the effect of different strategies of pre-imputation quality filtering on the performance of the widely used imputation algorithms MaCH and IMPUTE. Results: We considered three scenarios: imputation of partially missing genotypes with usage of an external reference panel, without usage of an external reference panel, as well as imputation of completely un-typed SNPs using an external reference panel. We first created various datasets applying different SNP quality filters and masking certain percentages of randomly selected high-quality SNPs. We imputed these SNPs and compared the results between the different filtering scenarios by using established and newly proposed measures of imputation quality. While the established measures assess certainty of imputation results, our newly proposed measures focus on the agreement with true genotypes. These measures showed that pre-imputation SNP-filtering might be detrimental regarding imputation quality. Moreover, the strongest drivers of imputation quality were in general the burden of missingness and the number of SNPs used for imputation. We also found that using a reference panel always improves imputation quality of partially missing genotypes. MaCH performed slightly better than IMPUTE2 in most of our scenarios. Again, these results were more pronounced when using our newly defined measures of imputation quality. Conclusion: Even a moderate filtering has a detrimental effect on the imputation quality. Therefore little or no SNP filtering prior to imputation appears to be the best strategy for imputing small to moderately sized datasets. Our results also showed that for these datasets, MaCH performs slightly better than IMPUTE2 in most scenarios at the cost of increased computing time.",NA,NA,"AUG 12",2014,15,"",NA,"10.1186/s12863-014-0088-5",NA,"s12863-014-0088-5"

We demonstrated that individual mosquitoes from Indonesia, Australia, Vietnam and Brazil can be assigned with a very high degree of confidence to their region of origin using a large SNP panel. We also showed that familial relatedness of samples from a 0.4 km(2) area could be confidently established with a subset of SNPs. Conclusions: Using a cost-effective customized RAD sequencing approach supported by our bioinformatics tools, we characterized over 18,000 SNPs in field samples of the dengue fever mosquito Ae. aegypti. The variants were annotated and positioned onto the three Ae. aegypti chromosomes. The new SNP set provided much greater resolution in detecting population structure and estimating fine-scale relatedness than a set of polymorphic microsatellites.

High-density genotyping arrays have only recently been developed for some economically important species such as conifers. The potential for using genomic technologies in association mapping and breeding depends largely on the genome wide patterns of diversity and linkage disequilibrium in current breeding populations. This study aims to deepen our knowledge regarding these issues in maritime pine, the first species used for reforestation in south western Europe. Results: Using a new map merging algorithm, we first established a 1,712 cM composite linkage map (comprising 1,838 SNP markers in 12 linkage groups) by bringing together three already available genetic maps. Using rigorous statistical testing based on kernel density estimation and resampling we identified cold and hot spots of recombination. In parallel, 186 unrelated trees of a mass-selected population were genotyped using a 12k-SNP array. A total of 2,600 informative SNPs allowed to describe historical recombination, genetic diversity and genetic structure of this recently domesticated breeding pool that forms the basis of much of the current and future breeding of this species. We observe very low levels of population genetic structure and find no evidence that artificial selection has caused a reduction in genetic diversity. By combining these two pieces of information, we provided the map position of 1,671 SNPs corresponding to 1,192 different loci. This made it possible to analyze the spatial pattern of genetic diversity (H-e) and long distance linkage disequilibrium (LD) along the chromosomes. We found no particular pattern in the empirical variogram of H-e across the 12 linkage groups and, as expected for an outcrossing species with large effective population size, we observed an almost complete lack of long distance LD.

Susceptibility to fracture may be due to underlying disturbances in bone metabolism which have a genetic cause. Fracture risk has been shown to be heritable in several species but this study is the first genetic analysis of fracture risk in the horse. Results: Fracture cases (n = 269) were horses that sustained catastrophic distal limb fractures while racing on UK racecourses, necessitating euthanasia. Control horses (n = 253) were over 4 years of age, were racing during the same time period as the cases, and had no history of fracture at the time the study was carried out. The horses sampled were bred for both flat and National Hunt (NH) jump racing. 43,417 SNPs were employed to perform a genome-wide association analysis and to estimate the proportion of genetic variance attributable to the SNPs on each chromosome using restricted maximum likelihood (REML). Significant genetic variation associated with fracture risk was found on chromosomes 9, 18, 22 and 31. Three SNPs on chromosome 18 (62.05 Mb - 62.15 Mb) and one SNP on chromosome 1 (14.17 Mb) reached genome-wide significance (p < 0.05) in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Two of the SNPs on ECA 18 were located in a haplotype block containing the gene zinc finger protein 804A (ZNF804A). One haplotype within this block has a protective effect (controls at 1.95 times less risk of fracture than cases, p = 1 x 10(-4)), while a second haplotype increases fracture risk (cases at 3.39 times higher risk of fracture than controls, p = 0.042). Conclusions: Fracture risk in the Thoroughbred horse is a complex condition with an underlying genetic basis. Multiple genomic regions contribute to susceptibility to fracture risk. This suggests there is the potential to develop SNP-based estimators for genetic risk of fracture in the Thoroughbred racehorse, using methods pioneered in livestock genetics such as genomic selection.

Susceptibility to recurrent acute OM and chronic OM with effusion is 40-70% heritable. Linkage studies provide evidence for multiple putative OM susceptibility loci. This study attempts to replicate these linkages in a Western Australian (WA) population, and to identify the etiological gene(s) in a replicated region. Methods: Microsatellites were genotyped in 468 individuals from 101 multicase families (208 OM cases) from the WA Family Study of OM (WAFSOM) and non-parametric linkage analysis carried out in ALLEGRO. Association mapping utilized dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data extracted from Illumina 660 W-Quad analysis of 256 OM cases and 575 controls from the WA Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study. Logistic regression analysis was undertaken in ProbABEL. RT-PCR was used to compare gene expression in paired adenoid and tonsil samples, and in epithelial and macrophage cell lines. Comparative genomics methods were used to identify putative regulatory elements and transcription factor binding sites potentially affected by associated SNPs. Results: Evidence for linkage was observed at 10q26.3 (Z(lr) = 2.69; P = 0.0036; D10S1770) with borderline evidence for linkage at 10q22.3 (Z(lr) = 1.64; P = 0.05; D10S206). No evidence for linkage was seen at 3p25.3, 17q12, or 19q13.43. Peak association at 10q26.3 was in the intergenic region between TCERG1L and PPP2R2D (rs7922424; P = 9.47 x 10(-6)), immediately under the peak of linkage. Independent associations were observed at DOCK1 (rs9418832; P = 7.48 x 10(-5)) and ADAM12 (rs7902734; P = 8.04 x 10(-4)). RT-PCR analysis confirmed expression of all 4 genes in adenoid samples. ADAM12, DOCK1 and PPP2R2D, but not TCERG1L, were expressed in respiratory epithelial and macrophage cell lines. A significantly associated polymorphism (rs7087384) in strong LD with the top SNP (rs7922424; r(2) = 0.97) alters a transcription factor binding site (CREB/CREBP) in the intergenic region between TCERG1L and PPP2R2D. Conclusions: OM linkage was replicated at 10q26.3.

Eleven candidate genes were functionally validated using siRNA knockdown approach in multiple cancer cell lines. We also characterized the potential mechanisms of genes by determining their influence on the activity of 10 cancer-related signaling pathways using reporter gene assays. Most SNPs regulated gene expression in a trans manner, except 7 SNPs in the PIGB gene that were significantly associated with both the expression of PIGB and gemcitabine cytotoxicity.

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the poplar ortholog of the class III homeodomain-leucine zipper transcription factor gene REVOLUTA (PtREV) were significantly associated with three specific traits. Based on SNP associations with fungal resistance, leaf drop, and cellulose content, the PtREV gene contains three potential regulatory sites within noncoding regions at the gene's 3' end, where alternative splicing and messenger RNA processing actively occur.

However, there is an incomplete understanding of the interrelationship between these factors and the extent to which they interact to impact disease risk. In the present study, we aimed to gain insight into this relationship by identifying DNA methylation marks that are candidate mediators of ovarian cancer genetic risk. Methods: We used 214 cases and 214 age-matched controls from the Mayo Clinic Ovarian Cancer Study. Pretreatment, blood-derived DNA was profiled for genome-wide methylation (Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 27 Bead Array) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, Illumina Infinium HD Human 610-Quad Bead Array). The Causal Inference Test (CIT) was implemented to distinguish CpG sites that mediate genetic risk, from those that are consequential or independently acted on by genotype. Results: Controlling for the estimated distribution of immune cells and other key covariates, our initial epigenome-wide association analysis revealed 1,993 significantly differentially methylated CpGs that between cases and controls (FDR, q < 0.05). The relationship between methylation and case-control status for these 1,993 CpGs was found to be highly consistent with the results of previously published, independent study that consisted of peripheral blood DNA methylation signatures in 131 pretreatment cases and 274 controls. Implementation of the CIT test revealed 17 CpG/SNP pairs, comprising 13 unique CpGs and 17 unique SNPs, which represent potential methylation-mediated relationships between genotype and EOC risk. Of these 13 CpGs, several are associated with immune related genes and genes that have been previously shown to exhibit altered expression in the context of cancer.

Previously, we and others have demonstrated that identity-by-descent (IBD) information generated from high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data can greatly improve the power and accuracy of genetic relationship detection. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) marks the final step in increasing genetic marker density by assaying all single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), and thus has the potential to further improve relationship detection by enabling more accurate detection of IBD segments and more precise resolution of IBD segment boundaries. However, WGS introduces new complexities that must be addressed in order to achieve these improvements in relationship detection. To evaluate these complexities, we estimated genetic relationships from WGS data for 1490 known pairwise relationships among 258 individuals in 30 families along with 46 population samples as controls. We identified several genomic regions with excess pairwise IBD in both the pedigree and control datasets using three established IBD methods: GERMLINE, fastIBD, and ISCA. These spurious IBD segments produced a 10-fold increase in the rate of detected false-positive relationships among controls compared to high-density microarray datasets. To address this issue, we developed a new method to identify and mask genomic regions with excess IBD. This method, implemented in ERSA 2.0, fully resolved the inflated cryptic relationship detection rates while improving relationship estimation accuracy. ERSA 2.0 detected all 1st through 6th degree relationships, and 55% of 9th through 11th degree relationships in the 30 families. We estimate that WGS data provides a 5% to 15% increase in relationship detection power relative to high-density microarray data for distant relationships. Our results identify regions of the genome that are highly problematic for IBD mapping and introduce new software to accurately detect 1st through 9th degree relationships from whole-genome sequence data.",NA,NA,"JAN",2014,10,"1",NA,"10.1371/journal.pgen.1004144",NA,"journal.pgen.1004144"

Here we compare the performance of SSR and RAD-seq SNP methods to characterize clonal patterns in a self-fertilizing and highly inbred killifish, Kryptolebias marmoratus (mangrove rivulus) in Florida. RAD-seq analyses conducted on 18 inbred lineages of mangrove rivulus obtained from western Florida and a distant location in eastern Florida unveiled 481 polymorphic RAD loci of which 129 were homozygous within individuals and 352 loci were heterozygous in at least one individual. An initial UPGMA phenogram was constructed, based on 32 microsatellite loci, and used as a benchmark for comparisons with SNP-based phenograms, using a number of different criteria for SNP selection. A phenogram produced by the homozygous SNPs was in excellent agreement with the one generated from 32 microsatellite loci. However, heterozygous SNP data and RAD loci with more than one polymorphic site contributed more noise than usable signal and were unable to resolve clades consistently. This is likely due to errors in identifying homologous loci in the absence of a reference genome. In summary, although the RAD data were powerful in distinguishing the clonal lineages identified by SSR analyses, they also carried considerable phylogenetic noise. Our results suggest that RAD-seq methods should be used with caution for inferring fine population structure, and that stringent quality controls are necessary to reduce false phylogenetic signals.",NA,NA,"",2014,2,"",NA,"10.3389/fevo.2014.00074",NA,"fevo.2014.00074"

Several candidate gene studies have been performed in various populations, but most have been inconclusive. Given that gallstones consist of up to 80% cholesterol, we hypothesized that common genetic variants associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides (TG) would also be associated with gallstone risk. Methods: To test this hypothesis, the Epidemiologic Architecture for Genes Linked to Environment (EAGLE) study as part of the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study performed tests of association between 49 GWAS-identified lipid trait SNPs and gallstone disease in non-Hispanic whites (446 cases and 1,962 controls), non-Hispanic blacks (179 cases and 1,540 controls), and Mexican Americans (227 cases and 1,478 controls) ascertained for the population-based Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III).

Caries experience was recorded and DNA was extracted from blood samples obtained from all subjects. Sixty-one single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 13q31.1 were genotyped. Association between caries experience and alleles was tested. We also studied 1,481 DNA samples obtained from saliva of subjects from the USA, 918 children from Brazil, and 275 children from Turkey, in order to follow up the results found in the Filipino families. We used the AliBaba2.1 software to determine if the nucleotide changes of the associated SNPs changed the prediction of the presence of transcription-binding site sequences and we also analyzed the gene expression of the genes selected based on binding predictions. Mutation analysis was also performed in 33 Filipino individuals of a segment of 13q31.1 that is highly conserved in mammals. Results: Statistically significant association with high caries experience was found for 11 markers in 13q31.1 in the Filipino families. Haplotype analysis also confirmed these results. In the populations used for follow-up purposes, associations were found between high caries experience and a subset of these markers. Regarding the prediction of the transcription-binding site, the base change of the SNP rs17074565 was found to change the predicted-binding of genes that could be involved in the pathogenesis of caries. When the sequence has the allele C of rs17074565, the potential transcription factors binding the sequence are GR and GATA1. When the subject carries the G allele of rs17074565, the potential transcription factor predicted to bind to the sequence is GATA3. The expression of GR in whole saliva was higher in individuals with low caries experience when compared to individuals with high caries experience (p = 0.046). No mutations were found in the highly conserved sequence. Conclusions: Genetic factors contributing to caries experience may exist in 13q31.1.

The effective population size of these populations tends to be small, which enhances the risk of fitness reduction and extinction. High-density SNP data make it possible to undertake novel approaches in conservation genetics of endangered breeds and wild populations. A total of 97 representative samples of domestic and wild pig populations from the Iberian Peninsula, subjected to different levels of threat with extinction, were genotyped with a 60 K SNP panel. Data analyses based on: (i) allele frequency differences; (ii) linkage disequilibrium and (iii) runs of homozygosity were integrated to study population relationships, inbreeding and demographic history. Results: The domestic pigs analyzed belonged to local Spanish and Portuguese breeds: Iberian - including the variants Retinto Iberian, Negro Iberian and Manchado de Jabugo -, Bisaro and Chato Murciano. The population structure and persistence of phase analysis suggested high genetic relations between Iberian variants, with recent crossbreeding of Manchado de Jabugo with other pig populations. Chato Murciano showed a high frequency of long runs of homozygosity indicating recent inbreeding and reflecting the recent bottleneck reported by historical records. The Chato Murciano and the Manchado de Jabugo breeds presented the lowest effective population sizes in accordance with their status of highly inbred breeds. The Iberian wild boar presented a high frequency of short runs of homozygosity indicating past small population size but no signs of recent inbreeding. The Iberian breed showed higher genetic similarities with Iberian wild boar than the other domestic breeds. Conclusions: High-density SNP data provided a consistent overview of population structure, demographic history and inbreeding of minority breeds and wild pig populations from the Iberian Peninsula. Despite the very different background of the populations used, we found a good agreement between the different analyses. Our results are also in agreement with historical reports and provide insight in the events that shaped the current genetic variation of pig populations from the Iberian Peninsula. The results exposed will aid to design and implement strategies for the future management of endangered minority pig breeds and wild populations.",NA,NA,"OCT 30",2013,14,"",NA,"10.1186/1471-2156-14-106",NA,"1471-2156-14-106"

However, the phase of LD between a SNP and a QTL may differ between Bos indicus and Bos taurus because they diverged at least one hundred thousand years ago. Here, we test the hypothesis that the apparent effect of a SNP on a quantitative trait depends on whether the SNP allele is inherited from a Bos taurus or Bos indicus ancestor. Methods: Phenotype data on one or more traits and SNP genotype data for 10 181 cattle from Bos taurus, Bos indicus and composite breeds were used. All animals had genotypes for 729 068 SNPs (real or imputed). Chromosome segments were classified as originating from B. indicus or B. taurus on the basis of the haplotype of SNP alleles they contained. Consequently, SNP alleles were classified according to their sub-species origin. Three models were used for the association study: (1) conventional GWAS (genome-wide association study), fitting a single SNP effect regardless of subspecies origin, (2) interaction GWAS, fitting an interaction between SNP and subspecies-origin, and (3) best variable GWAS, fitting the most significant combination of SNP and sub-species origin. Results: Fitting an interaction between SNP and subspecies origin resulted in more significant SNPs (i.e. more power) than a conventional GWAS. Thus, the effect of a SNP depends on the subspecies that the allele originates from. Also, most QTL segregated in only one subspecies, suggesting that many mutations that affect the traits studied occurred after divergence of the subspecies or the mutation became fixed or was lost in one of the subspecies. Conclusions: The results imply that GWAS and genomic selection could gain power by distinguishing SNP alleles based on their subspecies origin, and that only few QTL segregate in both B. indicus and B. taurus cattle. Thus, the QTL that segregate in current populations likely resulted from mutations that occurred in one of the subspecies and can have both positive and negative effects on the traits. There was no evidence that selection has increased the frequency of alleles that increase body weight.",NA,NA,"OCT 29",2013,45,"",NA,"10.1186/1297-9686-45-43",NA,"1297-9686-45-43"

Lodgepole and jack pine hybridize in western Canada, which adds the opportunity for introgression through hybridization to contribute to population structure and (or) adaptive variation. Access to large sample size, high density SNP datasets for these species would improve our ability to resolve population structure, parameterize introgression, and separate the influence of demography from adaptation. To accomplish this, 454 transcriptome reads for lodgepole and jack pine were assembled using Newbler and MIRA, the assemblies mined for SNPs, and 1536 SNPs were selected for typing on lodgepole pine, jack pine, and their hybrids (N = 536). We identified population structure using both Bayesian clustering and discriminate analysis of principle components. Introgressed SNP loci were identified and their influence on observed population structure was assessed. We found that introgressed loci resulted in increased differentiation both within lodgepole and jack pine populations.

More recently, the GWAS approach has been utilized to identify regions of the genome that harbor variation affecting gene expression or expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). Unlike GWAS applied to clinical traits, where only a handful of phenotypes are analyzed per study, in eQTL studies, tens of thousands of gene expression levels are measured, and the GWAS approach is applied to each gene expression level. This leads to computing billions of statistical tests and requires substantial computational resources, particularly when applying novel statistical methods such as mixed models. We introduce a novel two-stage testing procedure that identifies all of the significant associations more efficiently than testing all the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In the first stage, a small number of informative SNPs, or proxies, across the genome are tested. Based on their observed associations, our approach locates the regions that may contain significant SNPs and only tests additional SNPs from those regions. We show through simulations and analysis of real GWAS datasets that the proposed two-stage procedure increases the computational speed by a factor of 10.

In contrast, few studies have been conducted within minority groups, which carry the highest burden of impaired glucose homeostasis and type 2 diabetes in the U. S. Methods: As part of the 'Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) Consortium, we investigated the association of up to 10 GWAS-identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 8 genetic regions with glucose or insulin concentrations in up to 36,579 non-diabetic subjects including 23,323 European Americans (EA) and 7,526 African Americans (AA), 3,140 Hispanics, 1,779 American Indians (AI), and 811 Asians. We estimated the association between each SNP and fasting glucose or log-transformed fasting insulin, followed by meta-analysis to combine results across PAGE sites. Results: Overall, our results show that 9/9 GWAS SNPs are associated with glucose in EA (p = 0.04 to 9 x 10(-15)), versus 3/9 in AA (p=0.03 to 6 x 10(-5)), 3/4 SNPs in Hispanics, 2/4 SNPs in AI, and 1/2 SNPs in Asians. For insulin we observed a significant association with rs780094/GCKR in EA, Hispanics and AI only. Conclusions: Generalization of results across multiple racial/ethnic groups helps confirm the relevance of some of these loci for glucose and insulin metabolism.

The use of these two approaches in parallel is especially attractive in nonmodel organisms that lack a sequenced and annotated genome, but only works well when population structure is not confounded with the phenotype of interest. Herein, we use population genomics in a nonmodel fish species, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), to better understand adaptive divergence between migratory and nonmigratory ecotypes and to further our understanding about the genetic basis of migration. Restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) tag sequencing was used to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in migrant and resident O. mykiss from two systems, one in Alaska and the other in Oregon. A total of 7920 and 6755 SNPs met filtering criteria in the Alaska and Oregon data sets, respectively. Population genetic tests determined that 1423 SNPs were candidates for selection when loci were compared between resident and migrant samples. Previous linkage mapping studies that used RAD DNA tag SNPs were available to determine the position of 1990 markers. Several significant SNPs are located in genome regions that contain quantitative trait loci for migratory-related traits, reinforcing the importance of these regions in the genetic basis of migration/residency. Annotation of genome regions linked to significant SNPs revealed genes involved in processes known to be important in migration (such as osmoregulatory function).

Coronary artery calcification (CAC) scores are independent predictors of CHD. African Americans (AA) have higher rates of CHD but are less well-studied in genomic studies. We assembled the largest AA data resource currently available with measured CAC to identify associated genetic variants. Methods: We analyzed log transformed CAC quantity (ln(CAC + 1)), for association with similar to 2.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and performed an inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis on results for 5,823 AA from 8 studies. Heritability was calculated using family studies. The most significant SNPs among AAs were evaluated in European Ancestry (EA) CAC data; conversely, the significance of published SNPs for CAC/CHD in EA was queried within our AA meta-analysis. Results: Heritability of CAC was lower in AA (similar to 30%) than previously reported for EA (similar to 50%). No SNP reached genome wide significance (p < 5E-08). Of 67 SNPs with p < 1E-05 in AA there was no evidence of association in EA CAC data. Four SNPs in regions previously implicated in CAC/CHD (at 9p21 and PHACTR1) in EA reached nominal significance for CAC in AA, with concordant direction. Among AA, rs16905644 (p = 4.08E-05) had the strongest association in the 9p21 region. Conclusions: While we observed substantial heritability for CAC in AA, we failed to identify loci for CAC at genome-wide significant levels despite having adequate power to detect alleles with moderate to large effects.

Accuracies of GEBV were assessed using 5-fold cross-validation. The accuracy of genomic prediction varied by trait and by method. Traits with a large number of recorded and genotyped animals and with high heritability gave the greatest accuracy of GEBV. Using GBLUP, the average accuracy was 0.27 across traits and breeds, but the accuracies between breeds and between traits varied widely. When the training population was restricted to animals from the same breed as the validation population, GBLUP accuracies declined by an average of 0.04.

The American pika (Ochotona princeps) is a small alpine mammal with limited dispersal capacity and low tolerance for thermal stress. As a result, pikas have become an important system for examining biotic responses to changing climatic conditions. Previous research using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) has revealed evidence for environmental-mediated selection in O. princeps populations distributed along elevation gradients, yet the anonymity of AFLP loci and lack of available genomic resources precluded the identification of associated gene regions. Here, we harnessed next-generation sequencing technology in order to characterize the American pika transcriptome and identify a large suite of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which can be used to elucidate elevation-and site-specific patterns of sequence variation. Results: We constructed pooled cDNA libraries of O. princeps from high (1400m) and low (300m) elevation sites along a previously established transect in British Columbia. Transcriptome sequencing using the Roche 454 GS FLX titanium platform generated 780 million base pairs of data, which were assembled into 7,325 high coverage contigs. These contigs were used to identify 24,261 novel SNP loci. Using high resolution melt analysis, we developed 17 of these SNPs into genotyping assays, which were validated with independent DNA samples from British Columbia Canada and Oregon State USA. In addition, we detected haplotypes in the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 of the mitochondrial genome that were fixed and different among elevations, suggesting that this may be an informative target gene for studying the role of cellular respiration in local adaptation. We also identified contigs that were unique to each elevation, including a high elevation-specific contig that was a positive match with the hemoglobin alpha chain from the plateau pika, a species restricted to high elevation steppes in Asia.

Advances in molecular genetics have led to the identification of several genetic markers associated with genes affecting economic traits. Until recently, the identification of the causative genetic variants involved in the phenotypes of interest has remained a difficult task. The advent of novel sequencing technologies now offers a new opportunity for the identification of such variants. Despite sequencing costs plummeting, sequencing whole-genomes or large targeted regions is still too expensive for most laboratories. A transcriptomic-based sequencing approach offers a cheaper alternative to identify a large number of polymorphisms and possibly to discover causative variants. In the present study, we performed a gene-based single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery analysis in bovine Longissimus thoraci, using RNA-Seq. To our knowledge, this represents the first study done in bovine muscle. Results: Messenger RNAs from Longissimus thoraci from three Limousin bull calves were subjected to high-throughput sequencing. Approximately 36-46 million paired-end reads were obtained per library. A total of 19,752 transcripts were identified and 34,376 different SNPs were detected. Fifty-five percent of the SNPs were found in coding regions and similar to 22% resulted in an amino acid change. Applying a very stringent SNP quality threshold, we detected 8,407 different high-confidence SNPs, 18% of which are non synonymous coding SNPs. To analyse the accuracy of RNA-Seq technology for SNP detection, 48 SNPs were selected for validation by genotyping. No discrepancies were observed when using the highest SNP probability threshold. To test the usefulness of the identified SNPs, the 48 selected SNPs were assessed by genotyping 93 bovine samples, representing mostly the nine major breeds used in France. Principal component analysis indicates a clear separation between the nine populations. Conclusions: The RNA-Seq data and the collection of newly discovered coding SNPs improve the genomic resources available for cattle, especially for beef breeds.

When analyzed within a population genomics framework, SNP-based genotypic data may be used to investigate questions of evolutionary, ecological, and conservation significance in natural populations of non-model organisms. Kokanee salmon are recently diverged freshwater populations of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) that exhibit reproductive ecotypes (stream-spawning and shore-spawning) in lakes throughout western North America and northeast Asia. Current conservation and management strategies may treat these ecotypes as discrete stocks, however their recent divergence and low levels of gene flow make in-season genetic stock identification a challenge. The development of genome-wide SNP markers is an essential step towards fine-scale stock identification, and may enable a direct investigation of the genetic basis of ecotype divergence. Results: We used pooled cDNA samples from both ecotypes of kokanee to generate 750 million base pairs of transcriptome sequence data. These raw data were assembled into 11,074 high coverage contigs from which we identified 32,699 novel single nucleotide polymorphisms. A subset of these putative SNPs was validated using high-resolution melt analysis and Sanger resequencing to genotype independent samples of kokanee and anadromous sockeye salmon. We also identified a number of contigs that were composed entirely of reads from a single ecotype, which may indicate regions of differential gene expression between the two reproductive ecotypes. In addition, we found some evidence for greater pathogen load among the kokanee sampled in stream-spawning habitats, suggesting a possible evolutionary advantage to shore-spawning that warrants further study. Conclusions: This study provides novel genomic resources to support population genetic and genomic studies of both kokanee and anadromous sockeye salmon, and has the potential to produce markers capable of fine-scale stock assessment. While this RNAseq approach was successful at identifying a large number of new SNP loci, we found that the frequency of alleles present in the pooled transcriptome data was not an accurate predictor of population allele frequencies.",NA,NA,"MAY 7",2013,14,"",NA,"10.1186/1471-2164-14-308",NA,"1471-2164-14-308"

Here, we sought to understand the biological consequences of a CD40 risk variant in RA discovered by a previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) and to perform a high-throughput drug screen for modulators of CD40 signaling based on human genetic findings. First, we fine-map the CD40 risk locus in 7,222 seropositive RA patients and 15,870 controls, together with deep sequencing of CD40 coding exons in 500 RA cases and 650 controls, to identify a single SNP that explains the entire signal of association (rs4810485, P = 1.4 x 10(-9)). Second, we demonstrate that subjects homozygous for the RA risk allele have similar to 33% more CD40 on the surface of primary human CD19+ B lymphocytes than subjects homozygous for the non-risk allele (P = 10(-9)), a finding corroborated by expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 1,469 healthy control individuals. Third, we use retroviral shRNA infection to perturb the amount of CD40 on the surface of a human B lymphocyte cell line (BL2) and observe a direct correlation between amount of CD40 protein and phosphorylation of RelA (p65), a subunit of the NF-kappa B transcription factor. Finally, we develop a high-throughput NF-kappa B luciferase reporter assay in BL2 cells activated with trimerized CD40 ligand (tCD40L) and conduct an HTS of 1,982 chemical compounds and FDA-approved drugs. After a series of counter-screens and testing in primary human CD19+ B cells, we identify 2 novel chemical inhibitors not previously implicated in inflammation or CD40-mediated NF-kappa B signaling.

They play an important role in camouflage, communication, mate recognition and mate choice. Most progress on understanding the genetics of pigmentation has been achieved via mutational analysis, with relatively little work done to understand variation in natural populations. Pigment patterns vary dramatically among species of cichlid fish from Lake Malawi, and are thought to be important in speciation. In this study, we crossed two species, Metriaclima zebra and M. mbenjii, that differ in several aspects of their body and fin color. We genotyped 798 SNPs in 160 F-2 male individuals to construct a linkage map that was used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with the pigmentation traits of interest. We also used the linkage map to anchor portions of the M. zebra genome assembly. Results: We constructed a linkage map consisting of 834 markers in 22 linkage groups that spanned over 1,933 cM. QTL analysis detected one QTL each for dorsal fin xanthophores, caudal fin xanthophores, and pelvic fin melanophores. Dorsal fin and caudal fin xanthophores share a QTL on LG12, while pelvic fin melanophores have a QTL on LG11. We used the mapped markers to anchor 66.5% of the M. zebra genome assembly. Within each QTL interval we identified several candidate genes that might play a role in pigment cell development. Conclusion: This is one of a few studies to identify QTL for natural variation in fish pigmentation. The QTL intervals we identified did not contain any pigmentation genes previously identified by mutagenesis studies in other species. We expect that further work on these intervals will identify new genes involved in pigment cell development in natural populations.",NA,NA,"APR 27",2013,14,"",NA,"10.1186/1471-2164-14-287",NA,"1471-2164-14-287"

We previously characterized a common 32-kb insertion/deletion variant of the PSORS4 locus at chromosome 1q21 that harbours the LCE3C and LCE3B genes. This variant allele (LCE3C_LCE3B-del) is common in patients with psoriasis and other autoimmune disorders from certain ethnic groups. Results: Using array-CGH (Agilent 244 K) in samples from the HapMap and Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP) collections, we identified 54 regions showing population differences in comparison to Africans. We provided here a comprehensive population-genetic analysis of one of these regions, which involves the 32-kb deletion of the PSORS4 locus. By a PCR-based genotyping assay we characterised the profiles of the LCE3C_LCE3B-del and the linkage disequilibrium (LD) pattern between the variant allele and the tag SNP rs4112788. Our results show that most populations tend to have a higher frequency of the deleted allele than Sub-Saharan Africans. Furthermore, we found strong LD between rs4112788G and LCE3C_LCE3B-del in most non-African populations (r2>0.8), in contrast to the low concordance between loci (r2<0.3) in the African populations. Conclusions: These results are another example of population variability in terms of biomedical interesting CNV. The frequency distribution of the LCE3C_LCE3B-del allele and the LD pattern across populations suggest that the differences between ethnic groups might not be due to natural selection, but the consequence of genetic drift caused by the strong bottleneck that occurred during out of Africa expansion.",NA,NA,"APR 17",2013,14,"",NA,"10.1186/1471-2164-14-261",NA,"1471-2164-14-261"

In two species for which a reference genome is available, similar results were obtained whether the reference was used or not, demonstrating the robustness of our de novo inferences. The population genomic profile of a hare, a turtle, an oyster, a tunicate, and a termite were found to be intermediate between those of human and Drosophila, indicating that the discordant genomic diversity patterns that have been reported between these two species do not reflect a generalized vertebrate versus invertebrate gap. The genomic average diversity was generally higher in invertebrates than in vertebrates (with the notable exception of termite), in agreement with the notion that population size tends to be larger in the former than in the latter. The non-synonymous to synonymous ratio, however, did not differ significantly between vertebrates and invertebrates, even though it was negatively correlated with genetic diversity within each of the two groups.

In breast cancer, the strongest associations included either SNPs in or gene burden scores for genes LDLRAD1, SLC19A1, FGFBP3, CASP5, MMAB, SLC16A6, and INS-IGF2. In prostate cancer, one of the most associated SNPs was in the gene GPRC6A (rs2274911, Pro91Ser, OR = 0.88, P = 1.3x10(-5)) near to a known risk locus for prostate cancer; other suggestive associations were noted in genes such as F13A1, ANXA4, MANSC1, and GP6. For both breast and prostate cancer, several of the most significant associations involving SNPs or gene burden scores (sum of minor alleles) were noted in genes previously reported to be associated with a cancer-related phenotype. However, only one of the associations (rs145889899 in LDLRAD1, p = 2.5x10(-7) only seen in African Americans) for overall breast or prostate cancer risk was statistically significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. In addition to breast and prostate cancer, other cancer-related traits were examined (body mass index, PSA level, and alcohol drinking) with a number of known and potentially novel associations described. In general, these findings do not support there being many protein coding variants of moderate to high risk for breast and prostate cancer with odds ratios over a range that is probably required for protein coding variation to play a truly outstanding role in risk heritability.

To identify novel susceptibility variants for CAD and confirm those previously identified in European population, GWAS and a replication study were performed in the Koreans and Japanese. In the discovery stage, we genotyped 2123 cases and 3591 controls with 521 786 SNPs using the Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0 chips in Korean. In the replication, direct genotyping was performed using 3052 cases and 4976 controls from the KItaNagoya Genome study of Japan with 14 selected SNPs. To maximize the coverage of the genome, imputation was performed based on 1000 Genome JPT+CHB and 5.1 million SNPs were retained.

Methods and Results-Among 6765 African Americans, we related age, sex, height, and weight-adjusted residuals for 9 cardiac phenotypes (assessed by echocardiogram or magnetic resonance imaging) to 2.5 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped using Genome-wide Affymetrix Human SNP Array 6.0 (Affy6.0) and the remainder imputed. Within the cohort, genome-wide association analysis was conducted, followed by meta-analysis across cohorts using inverse variance weights (genome-wide significance threshold=4.0x10(-7)). Supplementary pathway analysis was performed. We attempted replication in 3 smaller cohorts of African ancestry and tested lookups in 1 consortium of European ancestry (EchoGEN). Across the 9 phenotypes, variants in 4 genetic loci reached genome-wide significance: rs4552931 in UBE2V2 (P=1.43x10(-7)) for left ventricular mass, rs7213314 in WIPI1 (P=1.68x10(-7)) for left ventricular internal diastolic diameter, rs1571099 in PPAPDC1A (P=2.57x10(-8)) for interventricular septal wall thickness, and rs9530176 in KLF5 (P=4.02x10(-7)) for ejection fraction.

By approaching this question from an evolutionary perspective we show that, while additive variance can be maintained under selection at a low level for some patterns of epistasis, the majority of the genetic variance that will persist is actually non-additive. We propose that one reason that the problem of the missing heritability'' arises is because the additive genetic variation that is estimated to be contributing to the variance of a trait will most likely be an artefact of the non-additive variance that can be maintained over evolutionary time. In addition, it can be shown that even a small reduction in linkage disequilibrium between causal variants and observed SNPs rapidly erodes estimates of epistatic variance, leading to an inflation in the perceived importance of additive effects. We demonstrate that the perception of independent additive effects comprising the majority of the genetic architecture of complex traits is biased upwards and that the search for causal variants in complex traits under selection is potentially underpowered by parameterising for additive effects alone.

However, multiple subtypes of lymphoma are observed in some families, suggesting shared pathways of genetic predisposition to these pathologically distinct entities. Using a two-stage GWAS, we tested 530,583 SNPs in 944 cases of lymphoma, including 282 familial cases, and 4,044 public shared controls, followed by genotyping of 50 SNPs in 1,245 cases and 2,596 controls. A novel region on 11q12.1 showed association with combined lymphoma (LYM) subtypes. SNPs in this region included rs12289961 near LPXN, (P-LYM = 3.89x10(-8), OR = 1.29) and rs948562 (P-LYM = 5.85x10(-7), OR = 1.29). A SNP in a novel non-HLA region on 6p23 (rs707824, P-NHL = 5.72x10(-7)) was suggestive of an association conferring susceptibility to lymphoma. Four SNPs, all in a previously reported HLA region, 6p21.32, showed genome-wide significant associations with follicular lymphoma. The most significant association with follicular lymphoma was for rs4530903 (P-FL = 2.69x10(-12), OR = 1.93). Three novel SNPs near the HLA locus, rs9268853, rs2647046, and rs2621416, demonstrated additional variation contributing toward genetic susceptibility to FL associated with this region. Genes implicated by GWAS were also found to be cis-eQTLs in lymphoblastoid cell lines; candidate genes in these regions have been implicated in hematopoiesis and immune function. These results, showing novel susceptibility regions and allelic heterogeneity, point to the existence of pathways of susceptibility to both shared as well as specific subtypes of lymphoid malignancy.",NA,NA,"JAN",2013,9,"1",NA,"10.1371/journal.pgen.1003220",NA,"journal.pgen.1003220"

First published November 27, 2012; doi: 10.1152/physiolgenomics.00114.2012.-Menopausal hormone treatment (MHT) may limit progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD) but poses a thrombosis risk. To test targeted candidate gene variation for association with subclinical CVD defined by carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT) and coronary artery calcification (CAC), 610 women participating in the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS), a clinical trial of MHT to prevent progression of CVD, were genotyped for 13,229 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 764 genes from anticoagulant, procoagulant, fibrinolytic, or innate immunity pathways. According to linear regression, proportion of European ancestry correlated negatively, but age at enrollment and pulse pressure correlated positively with CIMT. Adjusting for these variables, two SNPs, one on chromosome 2 for MAP4K4 gene (rs2236935, beta = 0.037, P value = 2.36 x 10(-06)) and one on chromosome 5 for IL5 gene (rs739318, beta = 0.051, P value = 5.02 x 10(-05)), associated positively with CIMT; two SNPs on chromosome 17 for CCL5 (rs4796119, beta = -0.043, P value = 3.59 x 10(-05); rs2291299, beta = -0.032, P value = 5.59 x 10(-05)) correlated negatively with CIMT; only rs2236935 remained significant after correcting for multiple testing. Using logistic regression, when we adjusted for waist circumference, two SNPs (rs11465886, IRAK2, chromosome 3, OR = 3.91, P value = 1.10 x 10(-04); and rs17751769, SERPINA1, chromosome 14, OR = 1.96, P value = 2.42 x 10(-04)) associated positively with a CAC score of >0 Agatston unit; one SNP (rs630014, ABO, OR = 0.51, P value = 2.51 x 10(-04)) associated negatively; none remained significant after correcting for multiple testing.

However, the genetic stability of LCLs following prolonged culture has never been rigorously investigated. To evaluate genotypic errors caused by EBV integration into human chromosomes, we isolated genomic DNA from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and LCLs collected from 20 individuals and genotyped the DNA samples using the Affymetrix 500K SNP array set. Genotype concordance measurements between two sources of DNA from the same individual indicated that genotypic discordance is negligible in early-passage LCLs (<20 passages) but substantial in late-passage LCLs (450 passages). Analysis of concordance on a chromosome-by-chromosome basis identified genomic regions with a high frequency of genotypic errors resulting from the loss of heterozygosity observed in late-passage LCLs. Our findings suggest that, although LCLs harvested during early stages of propagation are a reliable source of genomic DNA for genetic studies, investigations that involve genotyping of the entire genome should not use DNA from late-passage LCLs.

However, follow-up studies in African Americans (AA) have shown no support for some of the most consistently BMI-associated FTO index single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). This is most likely explained by different race-specific linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns and lower correlation overall in AA, which provides the opportunity to fine-map this region and narrow in on the functional variant. To comprehensively explore the 16q12.2/FTO locus and to search for second independent signals in the broader region, we fine-mapped a 646-kb region, encompassing the large FTO gene and the flanking gene RPGRIP1L by investigating a total of 3,756 variants (1,529 genotyped and 2,227 imputed variants) in 20,488 AAs across five studies. We observed associations between BMI and variants in the known FTO intron 1 locus: the SNP with the most significant p-value, rs56137030 (8.3x10(-6)) had not been highlighted in previous studies. While rs56137030was correlated at r(2)>0.5 with 103 SNPs in Europeans (including the GWAS index SNPs), this number was reduced to 28 SNPs in AA. Among rs56137030 and the 28 correlated SNPs, six were located within candidate intronic regulatory elements, including rs1421085, for which we predicted allele-specific binding affinity for the transcription factor CUX1, which has recently been implicated in the regulation of FTO. We did not find strong evidence for a second independent signal in the broader region. In summary, this large fine-mapping study in AA has substantially reduced the number of common alleles that are likely to be functional candidates of the known FTO locus. Importantly our study demonstrated that comprehensive fine-mapping in AA provides a powerful approach to narrow in on the functional candidate(s) underlying the initial GWAS findings in European populations.",NA,NA,"JAN",2013,9,"1",NA,"10.1371/journal.pgen.1003171",NA,"journal.pgen.1003171"
